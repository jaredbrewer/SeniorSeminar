"Carl said, no, no -- but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.",,,The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.,,,,,I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.,Let's talk about the issues that divide us.,
If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.,,,And it's about a strong national defense.,,,,,"I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans - Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan - about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass- Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.",I want to reverse Citizens United.,
"Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.",,,"It's about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet.",,,,,Go to YouTube today.,And so - let's talk about issues.,
"They do whatever what they do, OK.",,,That's conservatism.,,,,,Look up Greenspan-Sanders.,"I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.",
"When we do business with China, they tax us.",,,Yeah.,,,,,Listen to what I told them then.,And I'm proud of that.,
"You don't know it, they tax us.",,,"OK, good, then I'll get to it.",,,,,I helped lead the effort against deregulation.,"You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.",
I have many friends that deal with China.,,,"Well, no, sorry.",,,,,"Unfortunately, we lost that.","Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you.",
They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.,,,Let me respond to that question.,,,,,The result is - was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.,I know this game.,
If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.,,,"Well, here's the response.",,,,,"Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster.",I'm going to stop this game.,
"I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.",,,"I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here, OK?",,,,,"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well.","But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over- leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.",
I'm a free trader.,,,This is a president -- this is a president who is trying to change this country.,,,,,"But in terms of the early states - Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states - it just doesn't work.",So I don't know - I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.,
I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.,,,"When he talked about change, he wasn't talking about dealing with our problems.",,,,,Your point is well taken.,People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.,
I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.,,,Obamacare was not an accident.,,,,,"I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely.",What we've got to do as Democrats - what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.,
I sell tens' of millions of .,,,The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident.,,,,,But this system is - I don't know if the secretary would agree - is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.,And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.,
I love China.,,,The gutting of our military is not an accident.,,,,,"but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated.",That's what this election should be about.,
"I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.",,,The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident.,,,,,It no longer works.,On the issue of Wall Street.,
I'm totally open to a tariff.,,,"Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country.",,,,,Nobody can become president based on that system.,"Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record.",
"If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.",,,"We better understand what we're dealing with here, because that's what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.",,,,,So what's the alternative?,"You know, I did - when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit.",
You can't deal in China without tariffs.,,,Yeah.,,,,,There are two alternatives.,"I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street.",
"They do it to us, we don't it.",,,I don't know of any problem in America that's going to be fixed with a tax increase.,,,,,"And, you know, we looked at it.","They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.",
It's not fair trade.,,,"We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.",,,,,"Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.",But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.,
I'm happy to have him tonight|,,,And one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet.,,,,,So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.,I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.,
"Neil, the problem with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.",,,Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world.,,,,,And you know what?,I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.,
"It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.",,,"And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.",,,,,We got 3.,I proposed changes in CEO compensation.,
We just can't do it any longer.,,,"The combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.",,,,,"5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece.",I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.,
You looking at me?,,,The solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase.,,,,,I think that's pretty good.,And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.,
Can I tell you what?,,,"It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again.",,,,,Let me just say this.,They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.,
It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.,,,"Well, first, we need to understand who they are.",,,,,Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.,"Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.",
They're never going to let it happen.,,,"ISIS is not just a jihadist group, they're an apocalyptic group.",,,,,"You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.",And why are they doing that?,
"Japan, the same thing.",,,They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.,,,,,Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.,These are guys who try to make smart investments.,
They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu.,,,And I'm not saying that's what's going to happen.,,,,,But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.,"They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it.",
Kamatsu is a tractor company in Japan.,,,The reason why it's important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own.,,,,,"These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.",And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.,
Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.,,,They are going to have to be defeated.,,,,,"Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record.","So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.",
And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.,,,"And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.",,,,,"A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record.","If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change.",
And that's why we have to use Carl and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.,,,It will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily.,,,,,That is what power is about.,It has to change.,
"And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?",,,"That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians.",,,,,That is what corruption is about.,And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.,
"Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.",,,We should ask more of the Saudis.,,,,,And that is what has to change in the United States of America.,"And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.",
We don't need that.,,,That will need to be backed up with more U.,,,,,"I would say that - that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass- Steagall legislation.",I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.,
"That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.",,,S.,,,,,"And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were - significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.",But I do not believe that that is enough.,
And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.,,,special operation forces alongside them.,,,,,And that is what I believe and many economists believe.,"And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.",
"And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.",,,And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes.,,,,,Time to break them up.,"You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.",
"They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.",,,"And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation.",,,,,"Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation.",And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.,
They don't want them made here.,,,They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet.,,,,,And here's where we are.,"But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.",
They want those planes made in China.,,,They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world.,,,,,The American people can judge.,So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.,
That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.,,,But it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.,,,,,Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.,We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.,
"No, the new planes.",,,S.,,,,,That is a lot of money.,My plan takes us further and it would do the job.,
"I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.",,,#NAME?,,,,,"They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.","Look we have a law - look, you know, I - I appreciate the senator's advocacy.",
I'll check for you.,,,Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages.,,,,,That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.,We have a law.,
"Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.",,,Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves.,,,,,That's it.,It was passed.,
It's one of the biggest problems our country has.,,,If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence.,,,,,I think it is too much power.,It was signed by President Obama.,
"Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.",,,"The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.",,,,,"Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.",It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.,
"They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.",,,"It will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.",,,,,"Yeah, I do.","And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president.",
But they can't get along.,,,"And why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS.",,,,,"I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.",So we have a law in place.,
They can't even make a deal.,,,ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida.,,,,,Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.,"If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it.",
"Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.",,,"In fact, they broke away from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough.",,,,,That's a fact.,"And from what you say, I know you will as well.",
We have to do something.,,,"This is who we're dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.",,,,,"And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people.",But that is not enough.,
Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.,,,"Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they don't trust this administration.",,,,,"In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.","And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me - the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys - is because I've got their number on all of that.",
So many companies are going to leave our country.,,,"This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran.",,,,,It's fraud.,And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.,
Thank you.,,,It poisoned the well with these countries.,,,,,"I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen|","You know, we can't just fight the last war.",
"Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.",,,It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.,,,,,"Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear.","We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans.",
"As you too know, I know I built a very great company.",,,"They also, by the way, understand what real U.",,,,,"When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage.","And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.",
"But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.",,,S.,,,,,I suspect the secretary agrees request me.,I will look into it.,
It's peanuts.,,,air power looks like.,,,,,"Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.","I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it.",
"I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.",,,They saw the Iraq war.,,,,,"And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?","But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs.",
"I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.",,,"They saw, up close, also Afghanistan.",,,,,Zero.,I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.,
"Run the company kids, have a good time.",,,They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause.,,,,,Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.,My view on this is look at my record.,
I'm going to do it for America.,,,"And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, that's not real commitment.",,,,,"So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?","Look at what I am proposing, and - we have a vigorous agreement here.",
So I would -- I would be willing to do that.,,,We know what real commitment looks like.,,,,,We're going to end that loophole.,We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.,
I would put it in a blind trust.,,,The -- the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago.,,,,,They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.,"I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.",
"Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.",,,He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans.,,,,,We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.,"I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health.",
"If that's a blind trust, I don't know.",,,And the coalition -- meaning U.,,,,,Can I work with corporations?,"Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies.",
"But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.",,,S.,,,,,Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?,We're missing other big energy companies.,
Thank you.,,,leadership on the ground would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.,,,,,Absolutely they are.,"We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.",
I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.,,,"Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, they're acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function.",,,,,And we should be proud of them.,"Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.",
"They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.",,,"Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them.",,,,,"But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.","I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.",
Half of them had tears pouring down their face.,,,Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.,,,,,I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.,"This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again.",
"They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.",,,"And, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we're going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.",,,,,OK.,We have no disagreement about this.,
And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.,,,"But, here's the bigger problem with all this, we're not interrogating anybody right now.",,,,,"Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.","But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people.",
It was a terrible sight.,,,Guantanamo's being emptied by this president.,,,,,"Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.","And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.",
A terrible sight.,,,"We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldn't be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States.",,,,,"com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002.","Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.",
"And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.",,,I think it's already happening.,,,,,"And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.",I agree with the president.,
"If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.",,,Look at the turnout in Iowa.,,,,,"Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq.","I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq - that is off the table.",
We will make America great again.,,,A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses.,,,,,And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.,"But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.",
We will win on everything we do.,,,There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire.,,,,,I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen - and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.,"And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.",
Thank you.,,,Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having.,,,,,I think he hit the nail on the head.,We're doing the support and enabling.,
I actually think I have the best temperament.,,,Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.,,,,,And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.,"And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.",
I built a massive corporation.,,,"Because people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point.",,,,,"And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers - U.","So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me.",
I employ thousands and thousands of people.,,,That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat.,,,,,S.,We just have to keep - try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back.,

I hit other things.,,,"She put classified information on her computer because she thinks she's above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America.",,,,,"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans.",I support trainers.,

I'm not one with a trigger.,,,"We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.",,,,,"Well, that's not quite accurate.",And the Afghan army is actually fighting.,

"That, I can tell you.",,,We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience.,,,,,"So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.",Because it's not just the Taliban.,
Am I allowed to respond?,,,"First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat.",,,,,"I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq.","We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.",
I have to respond.,,,"That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised.",,,,,"And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone.","So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it.",

And that's what's going to happen -- OK.,,,I think the more fundamental challenge we're now facing is what's happening to the U.,,,,,We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.,"A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.",
That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against.,,,S.,,,,,We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.,"Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.",
We're going to win with Trump.,,,"military -- I've said this many times, and I think it's important to start paying attention to this.",,,,,"So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.","So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.",
We're going to win.,,,Our Air Force is about to be the smallest it's been in 100 years.,,,,,"I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience - hat is not arguable - in foreign affairs.","And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.",
We don't win anymore.,,,"I'm sorry, in our history.",,,,,"But experience is not the only point, judgment is.","Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State.",

We're going to win with Trump.,,,"I think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and it's a lot more chaotic and dangerous.",,,,,"In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other.",Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.,

"First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows.",,,"Well, my brother's a veteran.",,,,,I never said that.,"You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions.",
"I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.",,,We're very proud of him in our family.,,,,,I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.,"I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.",
"I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing.",,,He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971.,,,,,And you're right.,I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.,
I think he has no idea what he's doing.,,,"And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.",,,,,They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.,It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.,
And our country is going to hell.,,,"And for years, he's had to go to get these dental claims.",,,,,"But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea.","We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.",
"So, I just want to say, we disagree on that.",,,"And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.",,,,,"They're Communists, they are our enemy.",But that is not our only problem with Iran.,
Is that okay?,,,A.,,,,,Well guess what?,We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.,
Good.,,,"asks him, well, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army?",,,,,Change has come.,They are destabilizing governments in the region.,
As to North Korea?,,,"And he says, well, it's the only time I ever jumped out of a plane.",,,,,So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.,They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.,
We have -- tremendous -- has been just sucked out of our country by China.,,,"But he's had to fight through this process, and I've watched it firsthand.",,,,,We don't.,A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.,
China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea.,,,That's why I'm proud that I worked in a bipartisan way.,,,,,"But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen.","I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.",
They have tremendous control.,,,We passed the V.,,,,,"And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary - and you can correct me if I'm wrong.","If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.",
I deal with the Chinese all of the time.,,,A.,,,,,When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.,The president doesn't think we should.,
I do tremendous -- the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.,,,"Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire -- allows the V.",,,,,I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.,I certainly don't think we should.,
I deal with them.,,,A.,,,,,OK.,"I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.",
They tell me.,,,"secretary to fire someone who's not doing a good job, who's a senior executive.",,,,,"I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions.","Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can.",
"They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea.",,,And the governor's right.,,,,,"But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries|",You know - let me correct the record.,
They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country -- they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country.,,,They've only fired three people up to now.,,,,,"Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.","As I - as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions.",
"I would get on with China, let China solve that problem.",,,More people will be fired if I'm president.,,,,,"Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid.","And you're right, I was against that.",
They can do it quickly and surgically.,,,But the portability part of it is incredibly important.,,,,,"And, who had nuclear weapons.",I was against it then I would be against it now.,
That's what we should do with North Korea.,,,Veterans should be able to take their V.,,,,,"And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure.","Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants.",
Good evening.,,,A.,,,,,"China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.","Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, ""Here I am.",
Yes.,,,benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to.,,,,,"I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.",Let's talk and make a deal.,
I don't think I am.,,,"When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose.",,,,,"I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.",""" That's not the way it works.",
I think I'm closer to common sense.,,,"Well, first of all, I don't believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater.",,,,,"No, I don't.","Well, we set conditions on Iran.",
We are going to repeal Obamacare.,,,It means that you believe that this institution that's been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society.,,,,,"I worry very, very much about an isolated country.","We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked.",
We're going to repeal Obamacare.,,,I respect people that believe differently.,,,,,That's what makes me nervous.,"And, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.",
We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.,,,"But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman.",,,,,Russia lives in the world.,"I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning.",
And there are so many examples of it.,,,"On the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue.",,,,,China lives in the world.,"We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on.",
"And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.",,,"It's a human rights issue and it's a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights.",,,,,"North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with.","We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.",
I am self-funded.,,,On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.,,,,,Dealt with effectively.,We do have to worry about North Korea.,
The only one they're not taking care of is me.,,,And on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live.,,,,,Let me agree.,"They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.",
We have our lines around each state.,,,And they're in conflict.,,,,,"You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired - I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast.",
The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare.,,,"And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence.",,,,,"And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans.","We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.",
The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health.,,,And I have chosen to err on the side of life.,,,,,"I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America.","But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies.",
We are going to end that.,,,Here's what I find outrageous.,,,,,That's what I did.,The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe.,
"We're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines.",,,There has been five Democratic debates.,,,,,And I brought it to the floor of the Senate.,"The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea.",
"We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise.",,,"The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists.",,,,,"Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans.",Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.,
They compete.,,,"Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.",,,,,We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed.,We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.,
So much better.,,,"Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right.",,,,,That is pathetic.,"They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria.",
"In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent.",,,They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election.,,,,,"This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.",They want to hang on to that.,
"What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen.",,,I do support protection for the life of the mother because I'm pro-life.,,,,,"So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.","I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense.",
We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.,,,I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws.,,,,,"What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise.","We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to.",
"And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.",,,"If I'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I'll sign it.",,,,,I did work with John McCain.,"The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.",
"Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.",,,But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws.,,,,,I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House.,"Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.",
"Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country.",,,"I've already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank.",,,,,"And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.",A.,
"Without it, you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have anything.",,,I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life.,,,,,A.,And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.,

You need eminent domain.,,,Thank you.,,,,,"Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers.",There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.,
"And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are -- I think I'm more than they are -- they tell me, oh -- well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline.",,,"You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail.",,,,,"The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s.","But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda.",
"The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK?",,,"I hadn't' seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of what's at stake.",,,,,"Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.","They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.",
You need eminent domain.,,,"Here in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age.",,,,,The last point that I'd make.,I will fight that as hard as I can.,
"And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.",,,What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in.,,,,,I had a hearing.,"I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.",
"And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property.",,,"And, that's why I'm asking you for your vote.",,,,,I had all of the veterans groups in front of me.,A.,
"When somebody -- when eminent domain is used on somebody's property, that person gets a fortune.",,,"You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us.",,,,,"And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.",", but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.",
"They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they'll get two or three times the value of their property.",,,The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.,,,,,A.,"Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.",
"But without eminent domain, you don't have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.",,,Thank you.,,,,,", understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?",All right.,
"So eminent domain -- it's not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely -- it's a necessity for a country.",,,,,,,,"Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good.","I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.",
And certainly it's a necessity for our country.,,,,,,,,We've got to strengthen the V.,And I say that with great - with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.,
Yes.,,,,,,,,A.,"I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign.",
Jeb wants to be -- he wants to be a tough guy tonight.,,,,,,,,We do not privatize the V.,I hope that I will be able to earn their support.,
I didn't take the property.,,,,,,,,A.,"They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.",
I didn't take the property.,,,,,,,,"Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion.","But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election.",
The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.,,,,,,,,"This is not a - this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.",And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.,
I walked away.,,,,,,,,"I think where we now stand - correct me if I'm wrong - you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates.",I've been vetted.,
"Well, let me just -- you know, he wants to be a tough guy.",,,,,,,,"We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.",There's hardly anything you don't know about me.,
"A lot of times, you'll have -- you'll have -- and it didn't work very well.",,,,,,,,"You know, so this is not - this is not the biggest deal in the world.","And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.",
Let me talk.,,,,,,,,"We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.","So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job.",
Quiet.,,,,,,,,"What the Des Moines Register said - you know, there were coin - I think there were half a dozen coin flips - a fairly chaotic type situation.",I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.,
A lot of times that's all of his donors and special interests out there.,,,,,,,,"At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.","And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability.",
So -- it's what it is.,,,,,,,,"And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa.","It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.",
"That's what -- and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets.",,,,,,,,"See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already.",And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.,
You can't get them.,,,,,,,,"And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion.",Absolutely I can.,
"You know who has the tickets for the -- I'm talking about, to the television audience?",,,,,,,,But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.,"You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that.",
"Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money.",,,,,,,,"Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process.","And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions.",
That's who it is.,,,,,,,,But let me just say this.,"They basically said yeah, didn't get her.",
The RNC told us.,,,,,,,,"In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire.",We tried.,
We have all donors in the audience.,,,,,,,,"For example, the last poll I saw - there may have been a new one - last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.",That was all a political ploy.,
"And the reason they're not loving me is, I don't want their money.",,,,,,,,There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.,"Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e- mail accounts.",
I'm going to do the right thing for the American public.,,,,,,,,These are polls.,"and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material.",
I don't want their money.,,,,,,,,Polls go up.,They are retroactively classifying it.,
I don't need their money.,,,,,,,,Polls go down.,"I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.",
And I'm the only one up here that can say that.,,,,,,,,"But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.",And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.,
"Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline -- do you consider that a private job?",,,,,,,,"Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.",I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.,
Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?,,,,,,,,"Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression.",I am 100 percent confident.,
Is it public or private?,,,,,,,,"I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.",This is a security review that was requested.,
Real -- a public use?,,,,,,,,"If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate.",It is being carried out.,
"No, it's a private job.",,,,,,,,We win governors' chairs up and down the line.,It will be resolved.,
It's a private job.,,,,,,,,"So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.","But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.",
You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.,,,,,,,,I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.,"Honest to goodness, this is - this just beggars the imagination.",
"Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I -- of -- of the word conserve.",,,,,,,,There's a process under way.,"So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.",
We want to converse our money.,,,,,,,,I will not politicize it.,No.,
We want to conserve our wealth.,,,,,,,,"And by the way - and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.","Yes, I do.",
We want to conserve.,,,,,,,,Not losing control of our campaign.,"And - you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.",
We want to be smart.,,,,,,,,"You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.","I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism.",
"We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend.",,,,,,,,"In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper.",I have strong feelings about that.,
We want to conserve our country.,,,,,,,,"Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did.","I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.",
We want to save our country.,,,,,,,,"So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.","I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it.",
"And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very, very strongly.",,,,,,,,What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.,"If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.",
"Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China.",,,,,,,,But that was only for - that was not to be on television.,Absolutely.,
I will bring jobs back from Japan.,,,,,,,,That's an important point.,Absolutely.,
"I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out.",,,,,,,,"That was just something - as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.","You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before.",
They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals.,,,,,,,,"Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are - all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes.",I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.,
"And now we're about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation.",,,,,,,,"It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.","I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.",
It is going to be a disaster.,,,,,,,,"Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.",This is an emergency.,
I'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast.,,,,,,,,That's number one.,"Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.",
"Under my tax plan -- right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world.",,,,,,,,We have to be very careful about making sure about that.,"I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.",
"Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations.",,,,,,,,"But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there.",I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.,
We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore.,,,,,,,,"But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing.","We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring.",
"Right now, they have $2.",,,,,,,,"So, when somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key.","That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.",
"5 trillion, and in my opinion, it's much more than that.",,,,,,,,They're never going to get out.,"If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.",
That's what the government says.,,,,,,,,"But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing.","You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.",
All of that money is going to come back.,,,,,,,,That's all.,"And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.",
"And we're not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving.",,,,,,,,Absolutely.,"I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.",
And they're all leaving.,,,,,,,,I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.,And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.,
"We have many, many companies that are leaving this country.",,,,,,,,"You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.",I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.,
We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.,,,,,,,,"In fact, I think I never have in my life.","Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.",
"Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil.",,,,,,,,But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility was so outrageous.,Now I have a very clear view about this.,
"And if we did that, they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now.",,,,,,,,What we are talking about are children being poisoned.,We have to trade with the rest of the world.,
"Now, I still say the same thing, because we're doing little pinpricks.",,,,,,,,That's what we're talking about.,We are 5 percent of the world's population.,
"We're not even bombing -- if somebody's driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, we're going to bomb.",,,,,,,,"We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.",We have to trade with the other 95 percent.,
"If they don't get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.",,,,,,,,We don't know how many thousands.,And trade has to be reciprocal.,
"We actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil, because we don't want to hurt -- pollute the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.,That's the way the global economy works.,
Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere?,,,,,,,,"And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.",But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.,
You have to knock the hell out of the oil.,,,,,,,,"And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.",So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.,
You have to take the oil.,,,,,,,,Last point on this.,I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.,
And you have also back channels of banking.,,,,,,,,And I suspect the secretary agrees.,We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.,
"You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of -- tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.",,,,,,,,One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.,"So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.",
So we have to stop those circuits.,,,,,,,,"Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.","Well, I - I don't accept that premise, Chuck.",
Nobody knows banking better than I do.,,,,,,,,It is disproportionately African-American and minority.,I think that we've got so much business we have to do.,
"They have back circuits, back channels.",,,,,,,,And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.,We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against - we're against income inequality.,
Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system.,,,,,,,,Absolutely right.,We're against the abuses of powerful interests.,
"So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up.",,,,,,,,"Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.",We're against a lot of things.,
"But it should have been done four years ago, not now.",,,,,,,,I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.,I'm for a lot of things.,
"You have to go in -- first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that'll very much weaken -- and it will happen fairly fast.",,,,,,,,I was not only in opposition to NAFTA - and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.,"I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.",
"They'll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they've accumulated.",,,,,,,,"I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood - I don't think this is really rocket science.","And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.",
"But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil -- not just bomb it, take it -- when you do that, it's going to dry up very quickly.",,,,,,,,We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.,"I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.",
"They're going to become a very weakened power, quickly.",,,,,,,,"I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.",I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.,
Thank you.,,,,,,,,I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.,"I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out- of-pocket costs.",
"Well, I'll tell you what.",,,,,,,,"I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.","I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.",
"In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people.",,,,,,,,"So, do I believe in trade?","Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.",
"We have things that we have never seen before -- as a group, we have never seen before, what's happening right now.",,,,,,,,"Of course, I believe in trade.","I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces - because that's the way Congress is set up.",
"The medieval times -- I mean, we studied medieval times -- not since medieval times have people seen what's going on.",,,,,,,,"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay?","You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.",
I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.,,,,,,,,We're going to China.,"Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure - we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.",
"No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done.",,,,,,,,""" Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.",The answer to both of those is no.,
"People get together, they make deals.",,,,,,,,Trade is one of the reasons for that.,I'm interested in making what we have work better.,
"Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O'Neil very successfully, you didn't hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all.",,,,,,,,I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.,I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.,
You have to be able to get a consensus.,,,,,,,,All right?,"I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.",
"Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that?",,,,,,,,We got to do that.,I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.,
It doesn't get any more amateurish than that.,,,,,,,,"But you miss - when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.",I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better - better than anybody had run it in a long time.,
A good deal maker would never make a deal like that.,,,,,,,,And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.,So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.,
"With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree.",,,,,,,,"So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.","And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.",
"But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that's part of being a deal maker.",,,,,,,,So let me be very clear.,"CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.",
"You can't leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker.",,,,,,,,"No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.","And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.",
It doesn't work that way.,,,,,,,,"Second point - second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country - largely African-American and Latino - the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.","We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.",
"You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done.",,,,,,,,"No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.","But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.",
"But, it's got to be the deal that you want.",,,,,,,,"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class.","So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows it will actually raise wages.",
Some?,,,,,,,,Start listening to working families.,You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.,
"The problem with executive authority for the president, it's really bad news for this reason.",,,,,,,,""" And as president, that's what I will work hard on.",That's what I want to do.,
"Since he's given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants.",,,,,,,,I agree with what the secretary said.,I never said that.,
He's not a king.,,,,,,,,We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.,"Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not - I'm not getting ahead of myself.",
He's a president.,,,,,,,,"And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand.",I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.,
An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the -- in the Congress.,,,,,,,,"I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.","If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.",
I've done it in Ohio.,,,,,,,,"And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.",That's true.,
I consult.,,,,,,,,I - my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.,That's true.,
"I could use executive orders, but I don't trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak.",,,,,,,,"Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.","Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary.",
"We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second -- in the second back seat of this country.",,,,,,,,"I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money.","I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.",
That's what we need to do.,,,,,,,,"But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.","You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities.",
And we can do it.,,,,,,,,We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.,"Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.",
And we can do it.,,,,,,,,We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.,"So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.",
Yes.,,,,,,,,I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.,How are you?,
"OK, good.",,,,,,,,I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.,Great to see you!,
"It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.",,,,,,,,Thank you all.,Hi everybody.,
"I think that -- I look at what's going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton.",,,,,,,,"Hi, Chris.","Well, I was really touched and gratified when I saw that.",
"I can tell you, I'm the last person that she wants to run against.",,,,,,,,How are you?,"You know, people here in Iowa remember we ran a really hard race against each other, and then I had the opportunity when he asked me to serve as a Secretary of State.",
And I think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing.,,,,,,,,Yes.,"And, it not only was a great working relationship, but it turned into a real friendship, and he knows how hard the jobs is.",
I've been all over the country.,,,,,,,,"And my wife told me to button my coat but I think I'm too fat, so I'm going to keep it like this.",He knows it first hand.,
"We're -- last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people.",,,,,,,,"Chris, our message has resonated much faster, much further than I thought it would.","So, I really appreciated wh he said, and how he said it because it was a positive reflection on what we have to get done, and how hard it's going to be, and therefore the stakes in the election are really high.",
It set up in about four days.,,,,,,,,"And I think what the American people are perceiving is there is something very wrong in this country when ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth, and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.","And, I think that's what voters are beginning to really tune in to starting here in Iowa.",
We have galvanized and we've created a movement.,,,,,,,,"And then on top of that, people see that that rigged economy is sustained by a corrupt, and I use that word advisedly, a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires today to spend as much money as they want through Super PACs to elect the candidates of their choice.","Yes, that was surprising.",
"A lot of it has to do with -- as an example, Josh's question on drugs.",,,,,,,,"And, all over this country, and it's not just Democrats, i is conservatives, it is Republicans, that are saying that is not what America is supposed to be about.","You know, I really appreciated him saying that because he said that - he had that great line which I love.",
"I'm the first person that said, Build a wall.",,,,,,,,"So, if you're asking me why is it that our campaign has created the kind of momentum that it has, I think we are touching a nerve with the American people who understan that establishment politics is just not good enough.","I think he said something like, you know, she had to d - he said I was like Fred Astaire and she had to do everything I had to do, only she was Ginger Rogers doing it backwards in high heels.",
"But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now.",,,,,,,,"We need bold changes, we need a political revolution.","And, I thought that was a really|",
A real wall.,,,,,,,,President Obama is obviously right.,A very cute remark.,
And you'll solve lots of problems.,,,,,,,,Being president is an enormously difficult job.,"But, you know, I understand that you get into the arena, and you are going to get pummeled, and pushed, and criticized.",
"But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton.",,,,,,,,It's a job that entails dealing with a million different issues.,I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think it was absolutely necessary to try to build on the progress that we've made.,
"Because -- assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe.",,,,,,,,"I think I have th background, I think I have the judgement to do that.","That we've made under President Obama against great odds, and that we've got to do everything we possibly can not to let the Republicans rip away the progress and turn us backwards.",
"So, I don't know that she's going to be running.",,,,,,,,"I would remind you, and remind the viewers that in 2002, when George W.",That would be such a loss for our country.,
"I mean, look.",,,,,,,,"Bush and Dick Cheney said we should go to war in Iraq, Bernie Sanders listened very carefully and I said no.","We need to build on it, and go further, and that's what I'm trying to do with my campaign in talking about all the issues that I thin are on the minds of all the people I talk to across the state.",
"And speaking of that, if she runs, she's running for one reason.",,,,,,,,I think that war is a dumb idea.,CUOMO: And you get to do that tonight.,
"She's going to be able to run for one reason, and that's because the Democrats are protecting her.",,,,,,,,I helped lead the opposition to that war.,We're going to get a question right from the voters.,
"Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely -- their lives have been destroyed.",,,,,,,,"And, if you go to my website, listen to what I said, and sadly enough - it gives me no joy.","2008 we're talking about, here you are again, another election.",
"But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot.",,,,,,,,Much of what I feared would happen did happen.,"Praise and promise coming your way, but another nail biter|",
We will win it handily.,,,,,,,,I do believe I have the background for the job.,Right.,
We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama.,,,,,,,,"Well, what Democratic Socialism means, to me, is that economic rights, the right to economic security is - should exist in the United States of America.","Look, it's a great country, despite what one of the Republicans says.",
"Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it's an incident done purposely -- which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action -- or if it is a mistake, it's on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.",,,,,,,,"It means to me that there's something wrong when we have millions of senior citizens today trying to get by on $11, $12,000 a year Social Security.","It's a great country, and we are all on the Democratic side having a spirited debate about the issues we care about.",
"The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they're afraid for their jobs, they're afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I'm telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.",,,,,,,,"It means there's somethin wrong when the rich get richer, and almost everybody else gets poorer.","I'm so proud you've seen my two Democratic opponents, and the three of us have run a campaign talking about the differences we have on issues.",
They can't act.,,,,,,,,"It means there is something wrong, and government should play a role in making sure that all of ou kids, regardless of their income, are able to get a higher education.","That's totally fair, that's what we want you to know.",
They can't act.,,,,,,,,"Which is why I'm calling for free tuition at public colleges and universities, and why we have to deal with this horrendous level of student debt that people are having.","The other side is not talking issues, they're talking insults.",
"They're afraid for losing their pension, their job.",,,,,,,,"Now, what's going on in countries around the world, in Scandinavia, and in Germany.","So, I'm proud of the campaign we've run, and what we've put out there before the American people.",
They don't know what to do.,,,,,,,,The ideas that I am talking about are not radical ideas.,"And, it's a tough campaign, and it should be because it's the hardest job in the world.",
And I deal with them all the time.,,,,,,,,"So, what Democratic Socialis means to me in its essence is that we cannot continue to have a government dominated by the billionaire class, and a congress that continues to work for the interest of the people on top while ignoring working families.","You have to pick a president, and a commander in chief, and you want to really vet th people that are running, and I'm really having a good time going around talking, and listening to folks.",
"We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police.",,,,,,,,"What this campaign is about, and what I believe, is creating a government that works for all of us, not just a handful of people on the top.","And, on Monday the people in Iowa get to be the first people in the world, Chris, to express an opinion about who should be president, and commander in chief, and what they want to see as our nominee to go up against the Republicans.",
"Well, they do.",,,,,,,,That's my definition of Democratic Socialism.,OK.,
"And, you know, they sue.",,,,,,,,"Well, I think people will support my medical - Medicare for All program because the United States today is the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.",Let me help you up here.,
"Everybody sues, right?",,,,,,,,"Now, I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act, and I think the Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things.","Well, I think it really depends upon who you're seeing and talking to.",
"They see excessive -- I mean, they go out, they sue.",,,,,,,,But yet we have 29 million people without any health insurance.,You know today in Oskaloosa I spent time with about 10 high school students who are enthusiastically working for me.,
"We have so much litigation -- I see the courts, I see what they're doing.",,,,,,,,"Your point is there are seniors today - and I meet them every day - who cannot afford the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs because in America - everybody should know this - we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.",I see young people across the state who are doing the same.,
"They sue, and you know what?",,,,,,,,"Last year, while one out of five Americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors write, last year, the three major drug companies made $45 billion in profit because they spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions.",But I'm totally happy to see young people involved in any way.,
We don't want excessive force.,,,,,,,,So I believe we should draw in the rest of the world.,That's what we want.,
"But at what point -- you know, either you're going to have a police force that can do its job|",,,,,,,,"I believe, as a principle, everybody should be entitled to health care as a right, comprehensive health care.",And we want to have a good primary to pick a nominee.,
"I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday.",,,,,,,,"And, by the way, if we move toward a Medicare for all, not only do we cover the needs of all people, including that gentleman, we will save middle class people thousands of dollars a year on their health care bills, because now we pay, by far, per capita, much, much more than any other country on Earth.","And then we want to have everybody join together to make sure we win in November, which after all is the purpose of this whole campaign.",
Tremendous people.,,,,,,,,"It is time, in my view, for us to have the courage to take on the insurance companies, take on the drug companies and provide health care to all people at an affordable cost.","You know look, I've been around a long time.",
"They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people.",,,,,,,,"But, Chris, that is an unfair criticism for the following reason.",People have thrown all kinds of things at me.,
They want to do their job.,,,,,,,,"If you are paying now $10,000 a year to a private health insurance company and I say to you, hypothetically, you're going to pay $5,000 more in taxes - or actually less than that, but you're not going to pay any more private health insurance, are you going to be complaining about the fact that I've saved you $5,000 in your total bills?",And you know I can't keep up with it.,
"And you're going to have abuse and you're going to have problems, and you've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems.",,,,,,,,"So it's demagogic to say oh, you're paying more in taxes.",I just keep going forward.,
But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.,,,,,,,,"Let's also talk about we are going to liminate - eliminate private health insurance premiums and payments not onl for individuals, but for businesses, as well.",They fall by the wayside.,
"Well, I -- I know Diane Foley very well.",,,,,,,,"Again, we are the only country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to rip us off.",They come up with these outlandish things.,
Her husband and -- these are tremendous people.,,,,,,,,"We spend three times more than the British, 50 percent more than the French We can do better than we're doing right now.",They make these charges.,
"I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation.",,,,,,,,"Yes, we will raise - we will raise the - we will raise taxes, yes, we will.",I just keep going forward because there's nothing to it.,
"I fully understand, James, one of -- that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw -- it was so horrible.",,,,,,,,"But also let us be clear, Chris, because there's a little bit of disingenuity out there, we may raise taxes but we are also going to eliminate private health insurance premiums for individuals and for businesses.",They throw all thi stuff at me and I'm still standing.,
"And I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists.",,,,,,,,Good.,"But if you're new to politics, if it's the first time you really paid attention, you go oh my gosh, look at all of this.",
"If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.",,,,,,,,"Sean, great question and a very fair question.","And you have to say to yourself, why are they throwing al of that?",
James Foley was a great young man.,,,,,,,,"And I start off with the premise that in the last 30 years, although my Republican friends don't like the term, there's been a massive redistribution of wealth in this country.","Well, I'll tell you why.",
His parents are incredible people.,,,,,,,,"It's gone from working families, trillions of dollars, to the top one tenth of 1 percent.",Because I've been on the front lines of change and progress since I was your age.,
"They've done such a good job, since his -- since his death.",,,,,,,,"So, yes, what this campaign is about is to say to profitable corporations who, in some years don't pay a nickel in taxes, to the wealthiest people in this country who sometimes have an effective tax rate lower than truck drivers or nurses, yes, you are going to start paying your fair share of taxes.",I have been fighting to give kids and women and the people who are left out and left behind a chance to make the most out of their own lives.,
"But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or you're gonna have so many other James Foleys.",,,,,,,,Now how am I going to pay to make certain that public colleges and universities are tuition-free and we substantially lower interest rates on student debt?,And I've taken on the status quo time and time again.,
"And one thing on the vets -- during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball to sarel and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.",,,,,,,,I pay for that because we're going to ask Wall Street to pay a tax on speculation.,"I have had many, many millions of dollars spent against me.",
"The one thing that we're not mentioning, there's tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I'm running things, that's going to disappear and it's going to disappear quickly.",,,,,,,,"We are also believing, I believe that after the working families of this country bailed out Wall Street, maybe it's their time to help the middle class of this country.","When I worked on health care back in 1993 and 1994, and I don't know if you were born then.",
Carolina.,,,,,,,,"Now, I believe that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling.","But if you'd been around and had been able to pay attention, I was trying to get us to universal health care coverage, working with my husband.",
"That's because he got Ben Carson's votes, by the way, but we won't.",,,,,,,,"That's roads, bridges, rail, airports, levies, dams.","Boy, the insurance companies, the drug companies, they spent millions.",
Our country that we love so much doesn't win anymore.,,,,,,,,"We all know what's happening in Flint, Michigan.","Not just against the issue, but against me.",
"We don't win with the military, we don't' win on the border.",,,,,,,,"Water systems, wastewater plants.",And I kept going.,
You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin.,,,,,,,,"I believe that if we end this absurdity of allowing corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profits to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and othe tax havens, we eliminate that, we're going to bring $100 billion into the Treasury.","And when we weren't successful, I turned around and said at least we're going to get health care for kids.",
"Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don't win with healthcare.",,,,,,,,"That money goes into rebuilding our infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs in five years with a trillion dollar investment.",And we got the Children's Health Insurance Program working wit both Democrats and Republicans.,
We don't win with trade.,,,,,,,,I have paid for all of our proposals.,And eight million kids have insurance because of that today.,
You look at what other countries are doing to us.,,,,,,,,"Alright, we got to put what I am doing in context.",So you got to keep going.,
China.,,,,,,,,"And, here's the context.",You can't give up.,
"Everyone, they're killing us on trade.",,,,,,,,Today in America we have more income and wealth inequality than we have had since 1928.,You can never get knocked off course.,
"If I'm elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win.",,,,,,,,"There has, Chris, been a massive transfer of wealth, I'm talking about trillions of dollars, from the pockets of working families into the hands of the top one- tenth of one percent.",That's my hope for you and for all the young people who are getting involved this first time.,
"Thank you, thank you very much.",,,,,,,,That's a fact.,Don't get discouraged.,
,,,,,,,,"So, if you are telling me that at a time when - Wall Street's recklessness, greed and illegal behavior brought this country to its knees, than I am going to say to them that they're going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes.",It's hard.,
,,,,,,,,"Fine, if that's the criticism I accept it.","If it were easy, hey, there wouldn't be any contest.",
,,,,,,,,I demand that Wall Street start paying its fair share of taxes.,But it's not easy.,
,,,,,,,,Again.,"There are very different visions, different values, different forces at work.",
,,,,,,,,"I believe, and you know, Iowa has played a very interesting role in the fight for public education.","And you have to have somebody who is a proven, proven fighter.",
,,,,,,,,"And, for a 100 plus years, what we have believed public education to be is up to the twelfth grade.","Somebody who has taken the on and won and kept going, and will do that as president.",
,,,,,,,,Free public education up to the twelfth grade.,That's why I hope you'll reconsider.,
,,,,,,,,Guess what?,Great.,
,,,,,,,,The world has changed.,"Well, I have the greatest respect for the vice president.",
,,,,,,,,A college degree today is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago.,But I think it's fair to say that I have a 40-year record of going after inequality.,
,,,,,,,,"People want to criticize me, fine.","And not only economic inequality: racial inequality, sexist inequality, homophobic inequality.",
,,,,,,,,I believe that every kid in this country who has th ability and the desire should be able to get a higher education regardless of the income of his family.,The kinds of things that go after people to put them down and push them back.,
,,,,,,,,And I will pay for that through a tax on Wall Street speculation.,"So since I was a young lawyer my first job in the Children's Defense Fund, I took on the problem of juveniles in adult jails.",
,,,,,,,,"The era of protecting the middle class, and working families is certainly something that I will make happen.","What kind of inequality can you imagine that's worse than that, taking a child and putting them in with adult prisoners?",
,,,,,,,,"I believe, for example, that when my Republican colleagues talk about cutting Social Security, I say that when you're living on $12,000 a year in Social Security, no, we shouldn't cut it.",And we went right after that to change that.,
,,,,,,,,We should expand Social Security.,I went after schools that were being turned into private schools that were really there because they wanted to escape integration in the south.,
,,,,,,,,"And, we do that by lifting the cap on taxable income.","I went by myself down to Alabama to do investigations because again, inequality stalks our education system.",
,,,,,,,,"So, Chris, this is what I think.",I was on the Legal Services Corporation.,
,,,,,,,,"When we live in a nation of so much income and wealth inequality, where the top one tenth of 1% owns as much as the bottom 90%, when the 20 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, that is not, to me, what the American economy should be about.",I chaired the board.,
,,,,,,,,"So, yes.",Inequality's also about not being able to get a lawyer.,
,,,,,,,,"People want to criticize me, OK.",You can't afford them.,
,,,,,,,,"I will take on the greed of corporate America and the greed of Wall Street, and fight to protect the middle class.",You can't stand up and have your voice heard and have your case adjudicated.,
,,,,,,,,Great question.,So I have a really long history of taking on all kinds of inequality.,
,,,,,,,,"Let me answer it, if I might, in two ways.","And when I went to Beijing in 1995 and said human rights were women's rights and women's rights wer human rights that was a statement about inequality: economic inequality, education inequality, cultural inequality, every kind of inequality you can imagine.",
,,,,,,,,I am probably the most progressive member in the U.,"Now, when you focus just narrowly on economic inequality, I've also been in that fight.",
,,,,,,,,S.,I was in that fight during my husband's administration.,
,,,,,,,,Senate.,And let's remember what happened there.,
,,,,,,,,"But, I have over the years, not only in the Senate, but in the House, worked with Republicans when there was common ground.","At the end of eight years, we not only had 23 million new jobs, what was most important is incomes grew for everybody, not just those at the top, more people were lifted out of poverty, incomes rose, in the middle and working people.",
,,,,,,,,"When I was in the House, in a number of years I got more amendments passed on the floor of the House working with Republicans than anyone else.","And today in Knoxville, in my town hall, I called on a man.",
,,,,,,,,That was number one.,"He said, we never had it so good except when your husband was president.",
,,,,,,,,Number two.,"Because we tackled income equality and produced results, not talk, action.",
,,,,,,,,"In the Senate, just a couple of years ago, in a dysfunctional congress I worked with people like John McCain, people like Jeff Miller over in the House, to pas the most comprehensive Veterans Health Care legislation in the modern history of the United States of America.",And that's what I will do as president.,
,,,,,,,,I have worked with Republicans when there is common ground throughout my career.,OK.,
,,,,,,,,"But, this is what I also want to say.",I'll try not to.,
,,,,,,,,But this is what I also want to say.,Hi.,
,,,,,,,,"In my view, you have a Congress today that is much more worried about protecting the interest of the wealthy and the powerful and making sure they get campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.",Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,"If we are serious about rebuilding the American middle class, if we are serious about providing paid family and medical leave to all of our people, if we are serious about ending the disgrace of having so many of our children live in poverty, the real way to do it is to have millions of Americans finally stand up and say, enough is enough, for people to get engaged in the political process, to finally demand that Washington represent all of us, not just a handful of very wealthy people.",Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,That's the way you bring about real change.,I'll tell you what.,
,,,,,,,,"Give me a shot here, Alexis.",I want to start by saying thank you for asking about foreign policy because you're absolutely right.,
,,,,,,,,"Now what I said, what I said on a television program, and I did not say it well, is that sometimes the base of an organization looks at the world a little bit differently than the leadership.","In fact, President Obama in his interview said something about that.",
,,,,,,,,"So if you have 100 percent Planned Parenthood voting record, 100 percent pro-choice voting record, there are people who are asking, why is the leadership not either supporting Bernie Sanders or why are they, you know, opposing him?","He said, you know, you don't get to the pick the issues you work on when you're president, a lot of them come at you.",
,,,,,,,,And my point is that I will fight - these are great organizations.,"They come in the door whether you open it or not, and even gave the example of working on a State of the Union, being at the desk in the Oval Office when one of his aids came in and said, the Iranians have just captured two of our naval vessels and have taken our sailors prisoner.",
,,,,,,,,I met with Planned Parenthood.,"You can't say, oh, OK, don't bother me now, I'll deal with that later.",
,,,,,,,,"They do a fantastic job not only in defending women's rights in general, bu talking about sexuality in America.",You have got to immediately be able to switch gears.,
,,,,,,,,They are a fantastic organization.,You've got to do all aspects of the job.,
,,,,,,,,Count me in as somebody who strongly supports them.,So let me tell you how I think about it.,
,,,,,,,,"So this was simply a question of endorsement policy, not whether or not I strongly support these organizations.","I think it's imperative you do your very best, every president, and certainly, I will, to avoid military action.",
,,,,,,,,Do I have your vote yet?,"It should be the last resort, not the first choice, to use diplomacy, even if it's slow, boring, hard to continue to persist and be patient to get results.",
,,,,,,,,I know.,"And that you also should use the enormous capabilities that we have to project our values around the world, our cultural values, our freedoms, our human rights, and respec for the dignity of all people.",
,,,,,,,,"I'm just kidding, but that is the difference.",I want to give you two quick examples.,
,,,,,,,,I support the organization.,"When I became secretary of state, what President Obama and I found was that the Iranians were on their way to a nuclear weapon program.",
,,,,,,,,"And of course, I understand that.",This despite all of the bluster from the George W.,
,,,,,,,,"But I think if you look at my record in terms of fighting for women's rights, I think there are very few members of Congress who have a stronger record.",Bush-Dick Cheney administration.,
,,,,,,,,"It's 100 percent lifetime, and I've been there for a while.",They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle.,
,,,,,,,,"In addition to that, you know, there have - as you know, women are making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.",They had built covert facilities.,
,,,,,,,,"That is nothing but old-fashioned sexism, and I am a strong advocate and will fight for pay equity for women.",And they had stocked them with centrifuges that were rapidly whirling along trying to create enough highly enriched uranium to have a weapon.,
,,,,,,,,"I believe that - and it's not only women, although it impacts women and women of color even greater, this level of pay inequality, inequity, is extraordinary.","Now our choices were, oh, my gosh, just fulminate about it, or turn our backs and just figure out that somebody else is going to do something, or try to get up a new strategy.",
,,,,,,,,"So we're goin to fight for pay equity, make sure that everybody earns the same amount for the same work.",We chose the third.,
,,,,,,,,"Also, what we have got to do is people cannot make it on 8, 9, 10 bucks an hour.","We said, look, we've got to get the world behind us to force them to the negotiating table.",
,,,,,,,,We have got to raise the minimum wage in this country to a living wage.,"So I spent 18 months putting together the coalition that imposed international sanctions on the Iranians that forced them, finally, to begin negotiating with us to get an end to their nuclear weapons program, to put a lid on it.",
,,,,,,,,That will impac all people.,It took 18 months to get the sanctions.,
,,,,,,,,It will impact women more than men as we raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.,It took me about another year to travel around the world convincing other countries to actually obey the sanctions.,
,,,,,,,,"Well, one more point, one more point, Chris.","And then I bega the negotiations, testing whether the Iranians would actually come and seriously negotiate.",
,,,,,,,,I'm trying to win her vote.,And then Secretary Kerry and the president did a great job bringing the agreement into fruition.,
,,,,,,,,Leave me alone here.,You cannot - you cannot imagine how tense it was because a lot of our friends and partners in the region basically just wanted to end that program by bombing them.,
,,,,,,,,All right.,Just bomb them.,
,,,,,,,,"Hillary Clinton and I have a disagreement on a very important issue that impacts everybody, but especially women.",Send them back a couple of years.,
,,,,,,,,I believe that we should expan Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income.,Just stop it.,
,,,,,,,,"That will help millions of low-income seniors, especially women.",I spent a lot of my time explaining to our friends why that was not a good idea.,
,,,,,,,,Ask Hillary Clinton if she's prepared to lift the cap on taxable income.,And we got the negotiation successfully done.,
,,,,,,,,Thank you very much.,We did put the lid on.,
,,,,,,,,I believe we have a path toward victory.,So that's how I thought about it.,
,,,,,,,,"Millions of people come together and say loudly and clearly, enough is enough.",Another quick example.,
,,,,,,,,Democracy is not a spectator sport.,We had another unfortunate spate of rockets going from Gaza into Israel in 2012.,
,,,,,,,,Good to see you.,I'm on the phone with the Israelis.,
,,,,,,,,Good to be with you.,They're trying to knock them out of the sky with their missile defense system.,
,,,,,,,,We're feeling great.,"But they're still landing and everybody is really worried that, you know, one of them is going to hit a big group of people, take out a big building somewhere.",
,,,,,,,,"Yes, I am, now that you ask.","So the Israelis are telling me, look, we've got to go back in.",
,,,,,,,,We're feeling really great.,We have to have a ground invasion again in Gaza.,
,,,,,,,,I think the message that we are bringing forth is resonating with the American people.,"I'm saying, no, please, don't do that.",
,,,,,,,,And you talked about money.,Let's try to figure out how do we resolve it?,
,,,,,,,,"One of the things that has happened in our campaign, Anderson, which has blown me away, it really has, is we have received three and a half million individual contributions.",We don't think we can resolve it.,
,,,,,,,,That is more than any candidate in the history of the United States up until this point.,"I flew from Cambodia, where I was with the president, to Israel, middle of the night, go see the Israeli cabinet, work with them on what they would accept as an offer, go se the Palestinian president, work with him to make sure he'd back it up, go back to Jerusalem, finalize the deal, fly to Cairo, meet with President Morsy, the Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, hammer out the agreement, announce it at about an hour before the deadline that we were facing.",
,,,,,,,,And you know what the average contribution is?,They got a cease-fire.,
,,,,,,,,"Hey, you heard.",There was no invasion.,
,,,,,,,,"And that's pretty -- and in a day of super PACs, where people are raising huge amounts of money from Wall Street and the drug companies, the fact that millions of individual contributions from working people and the middle class, who want us to go forward and to transform this country in very significant ways is very moving to me.",That's what you have to do.,
,,,,,,,,Right.,So every situation is different.,
,,,,,,,,Of course we're an underdog.,So I want to make sure I stay as close as possible to the non-intervention.,
,,,,,,,,We are taking on the most powerful political organization in the country.,That's why I say no American ground troops in Syria or Iraq.,
,,,,,,,,"And that's, you know, the Clinton organization.","Special Forces, trainers, yes.",
,,,,,,,,Secretary Clinton obviously ran here in 2008 and she won.,"Planes to bomb, yes.",
,,,,,,,,Her husband ran here several times before that.,No ground forces.,
,,,,,,,,So this is her fourth campaign in that family here in New Hampshire.,"Every part of this has to be done in accordance with our values, our interests and our security and partnership with other countries.",
,,,,,,,,"It is clear that many people in New Hampshire do know me, because I come from a neighboring state.","Well, first of all, I have a much longer history than one vote, which I've said was a mistake because of the way that that was done and how the Bush administration handled it.",
,,,,,,,,And her husband ran here several times before that.,But I think the American public has seen me exercising judgment in a lot of other ways.,
,,,,,,,,So this is her fourth campaign in that family here in New Hampshire.,"And, in fact, when that hard primary campaign was over and I went to work for President Obama and he ended up asking me to be secretary of State, it was because he trusted my judgment.",
,,,,,,,,It is clear that many people in New Hampshire do know me because I come from a neighboring state.,And we worked side by side over those four years.,
,,,,,,,,And I think we have support because people over the years have seen the work that I am doing in standing up for working families and the middle class.,And think about where we were when he became president.,
,,,,,,,,"But in general, we started this campaign nationally, as you well know, 40-50 points behind Sec.","As I just said, Iran on the way to a nuclear weapon, which would have destabilized the entire Middle East, created an arms race the likes of which we have never seen.",
,,,,,,,,Clinton.,We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.,
,,,,,,,,We had no money.,"Our best allies and friends in Europe and Asia were really put out with us because of the way they'd been treated by the Bush administration and were very skeptical that the United States was a good ally any longer and wanted to lead the world toward peace, prosperity and security.",
,,,,,,,,We had no organization.,I spent so much of my time getting back the confidence and the trust of our friends and allies around the world.,
,,,,,,,,And we had relatively little name recognition.,So I think we made a lot of progress.,
,,,,,,,,I think it's fair to say we have come a pretty long way in the last nine months.,"Now, do we have a terrorist threat?",
,,,,,,,,That's the media game.,Yes.,
,,,,,,,,That's what media talks about.,"We had a terrorist threat on 9/11, before President Obama took office.",
,,,,,,,,Who cares?,"Yes, we were attacked.",
,,,,,,,,The point is underperform -- the point is we are going to work as hard as we can to win.,So this is not something new.,
,,,,,,,,And after we do hopefully well here we're going to go onto Nevada and then South Carolina and do as well as we can all over this country.,This is a long-term challenge.,
,,,,,,,,"I got to say, all due respect, that's media stuff.",That's wh I've laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the radical jihadist terrorist networks that I think has the best chance of achieving that.,
,,,,,,,,Sure we do.,There is no time in human history where everything is going well.,
,,,,,,,,But some of these polls are off the charts.,And we now live in a very interconnected world where we know everything that is going on and where people look to the United States to help.,
,,,,,,,,We're not -- I mean I think this is going to be a very close election here in New Hampshire.,So we have to be leading.,
,,,,,,,,Sure.,"And that means we've got to be smart about how we try to assert our power so that it is constructive, makes a difference and does lead to greater peace and prosperity.",
,,,,,,,,I have made a decision to run for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States.,"But I am very proud of my record as secretary of State and what we accomplished, not only on specific trouble spots, but advancing women's rights, advancing gay rights, advancing religious freedom, Internet freedom and so many of the other values that we hold dear.",
,,,,,,,,"I was for 16 years in the House Democratic Caucus, for nine years in the Senate Democratic Caucus.",Hi.,
,,,,,,,,"Right now I am the ranking member of the Budget Committee, appointed by the Democratic leadership and membership.",Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,A couple of years ago I was very proudly the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee.,And thank you for your service in the military.,
,,,,,,,,So of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.,"One of the most distressing aspects of this campaign has been the language of Republican candidates, particularly their frontrunner, that insults, demeans, denigrates different people.",
,,,,,,,,In terms of Sec.,He has cast a wide net.,
,,,,,,,,"Clinton, I know the media is kind of making a big deal about this.",He started with Mexicans.,
,,,,,,,,"All that I said, which is simply true, is I think it was in November in Ohio.",He's currently on Muslims.,
,,,,,,,,You may recall this.,"But I found it particularly harmful the way he has talked about Muslims, American Muslims and Muslims around the world.",
,,,,,,,,"I don't know the context of it, but Sec.",And I have called him out continuously about that.,
,,,,,,,,"Clinton said some people call me a -- paraphrasing, some people call me a moderate.","It's not only shameful and contrary to our values to say that people of a certain religion should never come to this country, or to claim that there are no real people of the Muslim faith who share our values, and to have the kind of dismissive and insulting approach.",
,,,,,,,,And I proudly say that I am a moderate.,"It's not only shameful and offensive, which it is.",
,,,,,,,,That's what she said.,I think it's dangerous.,
,,,,,,,,So all I said you can't go and say you're a moderate on one day and be a progressive on the other day.,And it's dangerous in several ways.,
,,,,,,,,Some of my best friends are moderates.,It's dangerous because American Muslims deserve better.,
,,,,,,,,I love moderates.,"And now their children and they are the target of Islamophobia, of threats.",
,,,,,,,,But you can't be a moderate and a progressive.,I've met a number of parents who sai their children are afraid to go to school because they are worried about how they will be treated.,
,,,,,,,,They are different.,And we cannot tolerate this.,
,,,,,,,,Sure.,And we must stand up and say every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect.,
,,,,,,,,Could I stand up?,And we must stand up against the bullying|,
,,,,,,,,OK.,But there's another element to this that I want to mention.,
,,,,,,,,"Chris, thanks very much for that good question.",I was recently in Minneapolis where I met with a big group of Somali-Americans.,
,,,,,,,,This is what we are going to do.,"And I sat down and talked with them, and they shared some of the very same concerns you just did.",
,,,,,,,,The United States is the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people.,But they are also on the front lines of trying to protect their children from radicalization.,
,,,,,,,,"And we end up spending far, far more per capita on health care as do the people of any other country: Canada, U.",They are in the front lines in Minneapolis of working with law enforcement to make sure that what they see and hear they report in case there are any problems.,
,,,,,,,,K.,We have to protect ourselves in America in a unified way.,
,,,,,,,,", France, whatever.",That means making sure our Muslim friends and neighbors are part of us.,
,,,,,,,,"What we are going to fight for is a Medicare for All single payer program, which would provide comprehensive health care to your family and every family in America.",They are with us.,
,,,,,,,,So let me tell you what we do.,"They are on the front lines of defending themselves, their families, their children and all the rest of us.",
,,,,,,,,We raise your taxes if you're somewhere in the middle of the economy about $500.,And the same is true with Muslims around the world.,
,,,,,,,,But you know what we're going to do for health care?,We need a coalition that includes Muslim nations to defeat ISIS.,
,,,,,,,,"We're going to reduce your health care costs by $5,000.",And it's pretty hard to figure out how you're going t make a coalition with the very nations you need if you spend your time insulting their religion.,
,,,,,,,,So you're going to pay a little bit more in taxes.,So we need to stand up and point out how wrong this is.,
,,,,,,,,But you're no longer going to have to pay private health insurance premiums.,Hi.,
,,,,,,,,"Now, I've been criticized for this.",That I want to be the president for everyone.,
,,,,,,,,"But I believe that health care is a right of all people, that we should not have these deductibles and copayments.",And I believe that is exactly what any president should do.,
,,,,,,,,We should not be paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.,"You know, Chris Cuomo's father said one of the smartest things.",
,,,,,,,,"And our Medicare for All program will guarantee comprehensive care to all people, and save middle class families some thousands of dollars a year.","He said many, many smart things about politics.",
,,,,,,,,See.,"But you might remember he said you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose.",
,,,,,,,,"And, Chris, what happens in politics -- I don't want to shock anybody in the office.","You know, you can say all the kinds of things you want in a campaign.",
,,,,,,,,Sometimes people distort things.,"And we are drawing distinctions with the Republicans, and we should because I have very deep disagreements, as I just pointed out, with a lot of what they're saying and doing.",
,,,,,,,,I mean I've had 30-second ads run against me.,"But, once the election is over we must come together to work to solve the problems facing our country.",
,,,,,,,,Bernie is going to raise your taxes.,That is what I did.,
,,,,,,,,But they forget to say we're going to do away with your private health insurance premiums.,"I did it as a First Lady when I worked, as I said, t get the children's health insurance program.",
,,,,,,,,She attacks us.,"I did it to reform the foster care and adoption system with one of the most partisan Republicans in the house, Tom DeLay.",
,,,,,,,,But they forget to say we're going to do away with your private health insurance premiums.,I did it when I was in the Senate.,
,,,,,,,,"Bottom line here is we spend almost three times more per person than the British, 50 percent more than the French.","And, nearly every Republican I served with co-sponsored legislation that I introduced, and we worked to pass.",
,,,,,,,,"We can save substantial sums of money, and my Medicare for all system is funded in a very progressive way.","And, I did it as Secretary of State.",
,,,,,,,,"Yes, you'll pay a little bit more, but your health premiums will disappear.","Reaching out, talking wit Republicans all the time about what we were doing, enlisting their support, getting their advice.",
,,,,,,,,"Well, that's -- you know, that's true.","So, I know in order to deal with the problems I want to, to get the economy working, creating more good jobs, getting in comes rising, making sure we build on the affordable care act.",
,,,,,,,,But all of what I am trying to do assumes something.,"Get costs down, but improve it, get to 100% coverage.",
,,,,,,,,"When I talk about making public colleges and universities tuition free, and doing that and paying for that through a tax on Wall Street speculation.","Everything I want to do, I want to start from the belief that we can find common ground, and tha is exactly what I intend to do.",
,,,,,,,,"When I talk about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, which as you know is in disrepair all over this country, and talk about doing away with huge loopholes that major corporations now enjoy -- so that in a given year you have these large corporations making billions, not paying a nickel in taxes because they're putting their money in the Cayman Islands.","And, I see my friend Tom Harkin sitting there, and he knows from his years in the Congress, you always have to hope you can find common ground.",
,,,,,,,,Now how do we get these things through?,You got to bring peopl together like he did.,
,,,,,,,,"What this campaign is about is, not just electing a President, it is creating a political revolution where millions of people, many of whom have not been involved in the political process, stand up and demand a government which represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.","The Americans With Disabilities Act, what an amazing accomplishment.",
,,,,,,,,That's how we make change.,Right.,
,,,,,,,,"Well, I think what we -- you know, we had the, remember the Reagan revolution, and the Gingrich revolution, well, my revolution's a little bit different.",Yes.,
,,,,,,,,But it is a process.,"Yeah, well, Chris, it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, and I consider them more the adversaries because they are.",
,,,,,,,,"Look, let's be clear.","They have their set of objectives, we have ours i the Democratic side.",
,,,,,,,,We have one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth.,"But, that's why I gave you a short overview.",
,,,,,,,,"In the last election where Republicans won a huge victory, 63 percent of the American people didn't vote, 80 percent of young people didn't vote.",I work with all of them.,
,,,,,,,,"Now, when people don't vote, there's a political vacuum that's created.","You know, when I'm actually in office, they say really nice things about me.",
,,,,,,,,And I will tell you how it's filled.,"We have a whole long list of the nice things they say, what a good colleague I am, how easy I am to work with, how willing I am to try to find common ground And, then when I run, Oh my goodness it's just unbelievable.",
,,,,,,,,"It's filled by lobbyists and campaign contributors who could care less about the middle class, who are there to protect the wealthiest people in this country.","So, I have no - I have no problem in saying, yeah, we have political differences.",
,,,,,,,,"So what we are trying to do -- and I would tell you, Anderson, with some success -- is bring working people and young people and lower income people into the political process.",We're on opposite sides.,
,,,,,,,,"And when that happens, you know what, we will raise the minimum raise, we will have health care for all people, we will make public colleges and universities tuition free.","But, we're going to work as hard as we can, and here' what I know about how to get that done.",
,,,,,,,,Oh.,"It takes building relationships, and that is one of the hardest things to do in politics over ideological and partisan lines.",
,,,,,,,,Buts always make me nervous.,"So, I'm going to be just giving them all bear hugs whether they like it or not.",
,,,,,,,,"All right, Jason, fire away.","We're going to get together, we're going to talk about what we can do.",
,,,,,,,,Very good question and I thank you for it.,"Maybe we can get something done together, if not, maybe I can find that slice of common ground to find somebody who will work with me on achieving a goal that we want.",
,,,,,,,,"We are reaching out, as strongly as we can, for example to the African-American community, and to the Latino community.","So, that's the way the process should work, constantly looking for ways to make a difference and putting together the coalitions within the congress to pass laws.",
,,,,,,,,"And I think we are gaining more and more support in those communities, for a couple of reasons.",It would be very gracious of me to go back and talk to them.,
,,,,,,,,"Number one, within the African-American community, it's not only an economic issue, raising the minimum wage and providing jobs.",Hi.,
,,,,,,,,Youth unemployment for African- American kids now is 51 percent.,"Well, look.",
,,,,,,,,"So those are important issues, but I'll tell you what else is an important issue, and that is the criminal justice issue.",This is only still an issue because the Republicans want to keep it an issue.,
,,,,,,,,"The fact that we have more people in jail in American than any other country, disproportionately African-American and Latino.","They know it, I know it.",
,,,,,,,,"The fact that blacks and whites do marijuana at about an equal level, and yet four times more blacks get arrests.","And, I think it's very easy to answer, and as the gentleman who stood up before said, if you watched any of it, I answered every question.",
,,,,,,,,"The fact that blacks are more likely to be stopped by police in a, in a vehicle and get arrested than whites.","And, at the end of it, the Chairman said, No, we didn't learn anything new.",
,,,,,,,,Those are huge issues.,"No, well, because there was nothing new to learn.",
,,,,,,,,"And what I have said and repeat through a virtually all-white state, but I'll say this all over the country.",Why?,
,,,,,,,,"There will be no President who will fight harder to end institutional racism than I will, and we have got to reform a very, very broken criminal justice system.",Because there had already been eight investigations.,
,,,,,,,,"It breaks my heart, and I know that it breaks the hearts of millions of people in this country to see videos on television of unarmed people, often African-American, shot by police.",Most of them by Republicans in the Congress.,
,,,,,,,,"That has got to end, and these are issues that I take very seriously, Jason.","The House Intelligence Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and what did they conclude?",
,,,,,,,,"It's a guiding principle in my life, absolutely, it is.","That there were problems that night, but they were ones that we should look a not from the perspective of placing blame or pointing fingers.",
,,,,,,,,"You know, everybody practices religion in a different way.",But how do we make sure that never happens again?,
,,,,,,,,"To me, I would not be here tonight, I would not be running for president of the United States if I did not have very strong religious and spiritual feelings.",That is what I said immediately after it happened.,
,,,,,,,,"I believe that, as a human being, the pain that one person feels, if we have children who are hungry in America, if we have elderly people who can't afford their prescription drugs, you know what, that impacts you, that impacts me.",That's why I put together an independent board to tell me as secretary of State what I needed to know and what we coul do to fix it.,
,,,,,,,,"And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say, it doesn't matter to me, I got it, I don't care about other people.",And I accepted all 29 of their recommendations.,
,,,,,,,,"So my spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.","And we were on the way to implementing them when I left, and that has continued.",
,,,,,,,,That's my very strong spiritual feeling.,So I am well aware that for partisan political purposes this continues.,
,,,,,,,,Good for you.,But let me tell you why this makes me not - it makes me sad.,
,,,,,,,,OK.,"It makes me sad because we've had terrorist attacks many times before in our country, haven't we?",
,,,,,,,,"For a start, in my view, we have got to crush ISIS, all right, for a start.","And we've had American, both civilians and military personnel the subject of attacks.",
,,,,,,,,"And as somebody who voted against the war in Iraq, what I believe is we've got to learn the lessons of that war.","When Ronald Reagan was president in 1983, our Marine barracks, our embassy were attacked in Beirut.",
,,,,,,,,"So we have to destroy ISIS, but we have to be not just tough, we have to be smart.",More than 250 Americans were killed.,
,,,,,,,,"And that means we work with a large coalition, led by on-the-ground Muslim troops.",The Democrats didn't make that a partisan issue.,
,,,,,,,,"King Abdullah of Jordan made the point, it will be Muslim troops who destroy ISIS, because ISIS has hijacked their religion.",We were horrified.,
,,,,,,,,"The United States, the U.","We were heartsick that Americans doing the work they were sent to do, civilians and military, were murdered by terrorists.",
,,,,,,,,K.,"So, the Democratic Congress worked with the Republican president to say what can we do?",
,,,,,,,,", France, Germany, Russia provide support, in my view, to the troops on the ground.",How do we fix this?,
,,,,,,,,So we've got to crush them.,Fast forward.,
,,,,,,,,"Internally, what we have got to do is significantly improve intelligence.",My husband was president.,
,,,,,,,,And I think we are not as strong as we can be in communicating with intelligence agencies all over this country.,Al-Qaeda attacked two of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.,
,,,,,,,,"If people come into this country, say, I've got to be screened although I happen to believe that we should accept refugees from the Middle East, from Syria and Afghanistan.","Car bombs blew them up, killed 12 Americans and hundreds o Kenyans and Tanzanians.",
,,,,,,,,"But I also appreciate the concern that others have, that we have got to screen those people, absolutely, thoroughly.",Madeline Albright was secretary.,
,,,,,,,,"There needs to be better coordination between federal, state, and local police.",She said we got to get to the bottom of this.,
,,,,,,,,"We have to work, which is very hard, making sure that we are tracking Internet transmission of information, where ISIS has been successful in getting information out and recruiting people.","She did the same as I did, commission an independent report.",
,,,,,,,,"But your concerns -- and again, thank you, you're a symbol of courage, that you went through that horror in Boston and you're going back and you're running again.",When the report came out sh made it public.,
,,,,,,,,Thank you for your courage.,I made the report I commissioned public.,
,,,,,,,,"Well, I think because she has a great deal of experience.",That's the only two times those reports have ever been made public.,
,,,,,,,,She was secretary of state of our country for four years.,"So again, it was terrible.",
,,,,,,,,"But I would say, Anderson, that the key foreign policy vote in modern American history was whether or not we should go into Iraq.",What can we do?,
,,,,,,,,"And Secretary Clinton was in the Senate then, I was in the House then.",How can we fix it?,
,,,,,,,,We both listened to the same evidence.,"It wasn't the subject of this kind of partisan, media-driven attack.",
,,,,,,,,"I made the decision, which I think history will conclude was the right decision, not to go to war.",People wanted to come together.,
,,,,,,,,"And if people want to go to my Web site, berniesanders.","And even after 9/11 when nearly 3,000 Americans and others who were working in New York City, the Pentagon, on that plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, were killed, we formed a commission.",
,,,,,,,,"com, check out what I said in 2002.",We said what went wrong?,
,,,,,,,,"And it gives me no -- no joy at all to say that much of what I feared would happen did, in fact, happen in terms of the destabilization of the region.",What can we learn?,
,,,,,,,,"So I think in terms of foreign policy, I have the judgment.",And then we moved on to try and do better.,
,,,,,,,,"We've been all over this world, met with foreign leaders.","So look, I understand that they will try to make this an issue.",
,,,,,,,,And I am confident that we can assemble a team that would do a great job.,I will continue to answer.,
,,,,,,,,Right.,And my best defense is the truth.,
,,,,,,,,"Gabriel, you have asked a -- an important question that is on the minds of millions of people, not just African-Americans, but -- but all people.",And that's what you will hear from now until I am elected president.,
,,,,,,,,Here's what I would do.,"Well, I think that they're - you know, look, I was delighted to get the Register's endorsement.",
,,,,,,,,For a start -- and I speak as a former mayor.,And it was a very generous one.,
,,,,,,,,"I was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, as many know, who worked very closely with our police department and believe that the vast majority of police officers in this country are hardworking, honest and are trying to do their best, doing very, very difficult work.","And yes, I think that's a fair criticism.",
,,,,,,,,"But if a police officer breaks the law like any other public official, that police officer must be held accountable.","You know I had no intention of doing anything other than having a convenient way of communicating, and it turned out not to be so convenient.",
,,,,,,,,That's number one.,"So again, we've answere every question and we will continue to do so.",
,,,,,,,,"Number two, you have seen on television, as I have, local police departments that look like occupying armies.","But you know maybe being faster, trying to scramble around to find out what all of this means, I probably should have done that quicker.",
,,,,,,,,"We have got to demilitarize local police departments, make them part of the community, not invading armies.",No.,
,,,,,,,,"third, and very importantly, we have got to make police departments look like the communities that they serve.",I'm not willing to say it was an error in judgment because what - nothing that I did was wrong.,
,,,,,,,,"So if there's a diverse community, the police department should reflect that diversity.",It was not - it was not in any way prohibited.,
,,,,,,,,"Fourthly, in terms of police action, the federal -- you know, police departments are run by local governments.",And so|,
,,,,,,,,But the federal government can play an important role in helping to fund model type programs.,"Well, apologizing sooner, as soon as you can.",
,,,,,,,,"For example, I think we have to rethink the use of lethal force.","But part of the problem, and I would just say this as, not an excuse but just as an explanation.",
,,,,,,,,"I think too often, lethal force goes first rather than last.",When you're facing something like that you got to get the facts.,
,,,,,,,,"Obviously, there are times when policemen must use their guns and use them as quickly as possible.",And it takes time to get the facts.,
,,,,,,,,"But I think what we need to do is figure out ways to train police departments so that police officers -- so that lethal force is the last resort, not the first resort.","And so when I said hey, take all my emails, make them public.",
,,,,,,,,So that's some of the things that I would do.,"That ha never been done before, ever by anybody.",
,,,,,,,,Don't tell anybody that.,And so we've been sorting our way through this because it is kind of a unique situation.,
,,,,,,,,"You know, it's hard to say what motivates anybody.",I'm happy people are looking at the emails.,
,,,,,,,,"I think as a kid, I did -- my parents weren't political.","Some of them are you know, frankly a little embarrassing|",
,,,,,,,,My brother was a little bit.,You know.,
,,,,,,,,My parents were not.,You find out that sometimes I'm not the best on technology and things like that.,
,,,,,,,,"But, you know, it -- you know, like in any school you see big kids picking on little kids, you know.","But look, I think it's great.",
,,,,,,,,And I resented that.,Let people sort them through.,
,,,,,,,,I always did.,And as we have see there is a lot of - you know a lot of interest.,
,,,,,,,,"And, you know, injustice bothered me very, very much.",But it's something that took time to get done.,
,,,,,,,,"And when I went to the University of Chicago, I had the opportunity to -- I wasn't a great student, I have to -- I have to admit it.",OK.,
,,,,,,,,"In fact, I learned more off campus -- I shouldn't say this to other students, though.",OK.,
,,,,,,,,"Do your homework, study, but I learned a lot off -- off of campus and I got involved in a group some may know, some not, called the Congress on Racial Equality.",I think that's great.,
,,,,,,,,"And it was a great group and we got involved in trying to desegregate the housing owned by the University of Chicago, segregated housing.",I think that's fabulous.,
,,,,,,,,And we also got involved in efforts to desegregate the school system there and I got arrested.,I loved it.,
,,,,,,,,"But I think, you know, as far back as I can remember -- and, Anderson, I can't tell you why, but injustice is something that I have always fought throughout my life.","You know, look, you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose.",
,,,,,,,,What is my evidence?,And we need a lot more poetry in this campaign and in our country.,
,,,,,,,,My evidence is that I am the former chairman of the U.,"So, I applaud that.",
,,,,,,,,S.,I love the feeling.,
,,,,,,,,Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.,I love the energy.,
,,,,,,,,"That I introduced, along with the support of the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam vets of virtually every major veterans organization, the most comprehensive veterans health care legislation in the modern history of the United States of America.",I obviously respect Senator Sanders greatly and appreciate what he has done in this campaign.,
,,,,,,,,"And sadly enough, you know it's one thing, Paul, Republicans talk about how much they love veterans.","But I believe that I'm the better person to be the Democratic nominee, and to be the president and commander-in-chief of the country.",
,,,,,,,,I got two Republican votes on a comprehensive bill supported by virtually the entire Veterans Committee.,Great.,
,,,,,,,,But I didn't give up.,It's OK.,
,,,,,,,,"What I did then is work with people like John McCain, Jeff Miller over in the House.",OK.,
,,,,,,,,"And we passed -- wasn't my ideal bill, I compromised.",OK.,
,,,,,,,,But it was the most significant piece of veterans health care legislation passed in modern history.,"Sorry, President Obama, sorry, Bill, Abraham Lincoln.",
,,,,,,,,"We put some $16 billion in to veterans' health care, as well as in taking care of veterans in a number of areas.",Abraham Lincoln.,
,,,,,,,,So it's easy for politicians to give speeches.,"You know, I - wow, when I think about his challenges, they paled in comparison to anything we have faced or can imagine.",
,,,,,,,,"But what my work in the Senate has been involved is to making sure that veterans in this country get the best quality health care possible, get their benefits when they need them, not wait years and years.","You know, more Americans died in the Civil War than, you know, the wars of the 20th Century put together.",
,,,,,,,,And we've made some progress on that.,So here was a man who was a real politician.,
,,,,,,,,Do our best to end veterans' homelessness.,"I mean, he was a great statesman, but he also understood politics.",
,,,,,,,,President Obama put a lot of money into that.,"And he had to work to put together, you know, the support he needed to be able to hold the country together during the war.",
,,,,,,,,And we have had some success.,"And while he was prosecuting that war to keep the Union together, he was building America, which I found just an astonishing part of his legacy.",
,,,,,,,,Still have a way to go.,"The transcontinental rail system, land grant colleges, he was thinking about the future while in the middle of trying to decide which general he can trust to try to finish the war.",
,,,,,,,,"So I think if you check my record it will tell you that I received the award, the highest award from the American Legion and the VFW for my work on veterans' issues.","That's what I mean, when you've got to do a lot of things at once, what could be more overwhelming than trying to wage and win a civil war?",
,,,,,,,,So I'm proud of that.,"And yet, he kept his eye on the future and he also tried to keep summoning up the better angels of our nature.",
,,,,,,,,Yes.,"You know, he was willing to reconcile and forgive.",
,,,,,,,,"Well, a fair question.","And I don't know what our country might have been like had he not been murdered, but I bet that it might have been a little less rancorous, a little more forgiving and tolerant, tha might possibly have brought people back together more quickly.",
,,,,,,,,"And I think you know the answer is that we have worked on many, many issues, Anderson.","But instead, you know, we had Reconstruction, we had the re-instigation of segregation and Jim Crow.",
,,,,,,,,And your point is fair that we should've acted sooner.,We had people in the South feeling totally discouraged and defiant.,
,,,,,,,,"We should've known what was going on in Phoenix, those long waiting lines and the lies that some administrators were telling us.","So, I really do believe he could have very well put us on a different path.",
,,,,,,,,"On the other hand, what we also did, though, is make significant progress in terms of dealing with homelessness.","And, as I say, our challenges are nothing like what he faced, but let's think ourselves about not only what we have to do right now, especially to get the income rising in America, especially to make college affordable, do something about student debt, keep health care growing until we get 100 percent coverage and so much else.",
,,,,,,,,"We passed a post 9/11 GI bill, which provides college education for the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.","But let's also think about how we do try to summon up those better angels, and to treat each other, even when we disagree, fundamentally disagree, treat each other with more respect, and agree to disagree more civilly, and try to be inspired by, I think, the greatest of our presidents.",
,,,,,,,,"We passed a Caregivers Act, which for the first time will provide support for those folks, mostly women, who are staying home with disabled vets.",Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,So I think in recent years we have made some progress.,"Thanks, Chris.",
,,,,,,,,Your point is a good one.,Great to see you.,
,,,,,,,,We should have done better.,You doing OK?,
,,,,,,,,There we go.,Good.,
,,,,,,,,You look younger than I do.,I am so thrilled that I'm coming to New Hampshire after winning Iowa.,
,,,,,,,,Why is that?,I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders.,
,,,,,,,,"Well, Marjorie, thank you for your question.","New Hampshire, the eyes of the world are going to be on you again.",
,,,,,,,,It is just not accurate to say -- you know sometimes people may portray me in this respect.,To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.,
,,,,,,,,It is not accurate to say that it's my way or the highway.,I am a progressive who gets things done for people.,
,,,,,,,,Let me give you some examples.,Here's what I want you to know.,
,,,,,,,,"I just mentioned that I compromised significantly with people like John McCain and Republicans in the House to pass what is regarded as the most significant piece of veterans' legislation passed in many, many years.",Hello.,
,,,,,,,,"Second of all, when I was in the House of Representatives, there were years, Marjorie, where I received more votes.",Hello.,
,,,,,,,,I won more amendments than any other member of the House of Representatives because I reached out where there was common ground with Republicans.,Thank you very much.,
,,,,,,,,So I think I have a history of being able to work with Republicans when there is common ground.,It feels great.,
,,,,,,,,But here is the major point that I want to make.,I've had just an amazing time.,
,,,,,,,,And I will continue to do that.,"We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day.",
,,,,,,,,"But here is the truth, and it's an unpleasant truth, and I know that not everybody here will agree with me.","And I'm seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people.",
,,,,,,,,"In my view, we have a Congress today that is much more interested in doing the bidding of the wealthy and the powerful, Wall Street and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industries, rather than the needs of the American people.",I have an uphill climb and I'm going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire.,
,,,,,,,,"And I believe we're not going to make the real changes that we need, dealing with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, reforming a corrupt campaign finance system which allows billionaires to buy elections, dealing with climate change, making sure we don't continue to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs when last year the three major drug companies made $45 billion in profit.","As you said, they're people that I feel very close to.",
,,,,,,,,"Now, how do we change all of that?","They've been good to my husband, to me, my family.",
,,,,,,,,"Well, where we can, we work with our Republican friends.",But what's most important is the first in the nation primary.,
,,,,,,,,"But change, in my view, and what history tells us, has always come from the bottom on up.","It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire.",
,,,,,,,,That's what the Civil Rights movement was about.,"You know, I don't know.",
,,,,,,,,That's what the women's movement was about.,"Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary.",
,,,,,,,,That's what the gay movement was about.,But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama.,
,,,,,,,,That's what the environmental movement is about.,And so I -- I'm very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running.,
,,,,,,,,"And what we need right now is a very profound and deep movement this country, where millions of people, in fact, get involved and say, I'm sorry, my kid is not going to have to graduate college $100,000 in debt.","I mean, we really have focused on issues.",
,,,,,,,,That's wrong.,"We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them.",
,,,,,,,,My mom is entitled to decent health care and prescription drugs that she can afford.,We bring different experiences.,
,,,,,,,,"Those are the kinds of movements that we need, and that's how we will bring about real change in this country.","But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults.",
,,,,,,,,That's because I was a Boy Scout too.,"And I think it's a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds.",
,,,,,,,,"I don't, Mark.","Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right?",
,,,,,,,,"You know, we'll take one term at a time.",And I said that I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.,
,,,,,,,,Got to get to the first term first.,"And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive.",
,,,,,,,,"Well, you know, thank goodness.",So I'm not going to let that bother me.,
,,,,,,,,"Let's not be ageist, Anderson.",I know where I stand.,
,,,,,,,,"You know, I am, thank God, in good health.",I know who stands with me.,
,,,,,,,,"And one can't predict the future, one never knows what happens tomorrow.",I know what I've done.,
,,,,,,,,"But, thank God, I have -- when I was a kid, I was a long-distance runner.",But I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved.,
,,,,,,,,"I was not quite the marathon runner, but I was a cross-country runner.","And I don't think it's appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they're thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment.",
,,,,,,,,And I've had good endurance and good strength my whole life.,That's just not anything we need to do.,
,,,,,,,,"So, you know, if I am fortunate enough to win the general election, and we do well, yes, I would like to run for re-election.",Let's have a good contest of ideas.,
,,,,,,,,Let me just say this.,Let's contrast where we stand.,
,,,,,,,,"I have, um, enormous respect for Hillary Clinton.",And that's what I intend to do for the next couple of days.,
,,,,,,,,I've known her for 25 years.,You think so?,
,,,,,,,,"And it's unfortunate, you know, in politics -- and everybody should know this.",That's amazing.,
,,,,,,,,"What media often wants you to do and you're asked this question, I'm sure it's the same for Secretary Clinton, beat her up.",Yes.,
,,,,,,,,Tell me something terrible about her.,"Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me.",
,,,,,,,,"Attack her, because that will make the news.","But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I've accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country.",
,,,,,,,,I have tried my best not to do that.,"But I -- well, you know, I don't really know, Anderson.",
,,,,,,,,You're looking at a guy who has been in politics a long time.,I think -- here's what I want young people to know.,
,,,,,,,,"And I have never run a negative ad in my life and I look forward to never running a negative ad in my life, OK.","They don't have to be for me, I'm going to be for them.",
,,,,,,,,I don't think people deserve that.,It doesn't really matter.,
,,,,,,,,"We have to -- as Secretary Clinton just said, that's what politics is about.","If they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve.",
,,,,,,,,It's a debate on the issues.,"As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere.",
,,,,,,,,Secretary Clinton has a long and distinguished public career.,"I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity.",
,,,,,,,,"She has worked with children when she began, and God only knows that we need a lot of work, given the fact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth.",And I understand that.,
,,,,,,,,So I respect it.,"I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get.",
,,,,,,,,I thought she did a good job as secretary of State.,"But at the same time I'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change.",
,,,,,,,,I served with her in the Senate.,So I'm impressed with them.,
,,,,,,,,We worked together on some issues.,And I'm going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important.,
,,,,,,,,"But there are other issues, Anderson, where I think she is just not progressive.",But you've got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people.,
,,,,,,,,I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street.,I have a lot experience doing that.,
,,,,,,,,That's just not progressive.,I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country.,
,,,,,,,,"As I mentioned earlier, the key foreign policy vote of modern American history was the war in Iraq.",And I hope to have the chance to win their support.,
,,,,,,,,The progressive community was pretty united in saying don't listen to Bush.,"Well, that's for Sen.",
,,,,,,,,Don't go to war.,Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people.,
,,,,,,,,Secretary Clinton voted to go to war.,I have a different take on it.,
,,,,,,,,"Virtually all of the trade unions and millions of working people understand that our trade policies -- NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, etc.","I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended.",
,,,,,,,,-- have been written by corporate America and the goal of it is to be able to throw American workers|,So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act.,
,,,,,,,,"millions of working people understand that our trade policies, NAFTA, CAFTA, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, et cetera, have been written by corporate America.","It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman.",
,,,,,,,,"And the goal of it is to be able to throw American workers out on the street, move to China and other low-wage countries, and bring their products back into this country.","You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it.",
,,,,,,,,And that's one of the reasons why the middle class of this country and the working class is struggling so hard.,And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies.,
,,,,,,,,"Secretary Clinton has been a supporter in the past of various trade policies, NAFTA and PNTR with China.",Sen.,
,,,,,,,,"Reluctantly, and after a lot of pressure on her, she came out against the TPP, and I'm glad that she did.",Sanders and I share the same goal.,
,,,,,,,,Every sensible person understands that climate change is real.,We want to get to universal health care coverage.,
,,,,,,,,It is caused by human activity.,"Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember.",
,,,,,,,,And we have got to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.,I fought really hard.,
,,,,,,,,"For a long time, Secretary Clinton was talking about the benefits of the Keystone pipeline.",The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me.,
,,,,,,,,"Well, there are no benefits to excavating and transporting some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world.",I know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests.,
,,,,,,,,I was in the lead in opposition to the Keystone pipeline.,"So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled.",
,,,,,,,,I'm in opposition to the pipeline right here in New Hampshire and the pipeline in Vermont.,I don't agree with Sen.,
,,,,,,,,I think we have got to move aggressively away from fossil fuel if we're going to leave this planet in a way that's healthy and habitable for our kids.,"Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again.",
,,,,,,,,"No, I didn't give it a ringing endorsement.",We're at 90 percent coverage.,
,,,,,,,,"No, not true.",I'm going to fix what needs to be fixed.,
,,,,,,,,I wrote a blurb for it.,"We're going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100.",
,,,,,,,,You may have the blurb there.,So we have a difference.,
,,,,,,,,And what the blurb said is that I think the next president should be very aggressive in bringing people into the political process.,And I think that is the difference.,
,,,,,,,,"And that, I believe, from the bottom of my heart.",Sure.,
,,,,,,,,"And if elected president, that will be a top priority of mine.","Hi, David.",
,,,,,,,,"I think in some areas, progressive -- for example, in the trade area.",Right.,
,,,,,,,,"Right now, I think they signed today the TPP in New Zealand.","Well, I'll tell you what, Dave.",
,,,,,,,,I think it is a continuation of bad trade policies.,I do have a litmus test.,
,,,,,,,,"The president supports it, I strongly disagree with it.",I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you.,
,,,,,,,,"On the other hand, let's be very clear.",The next president could get as many as three appointments.,
,,,,,,,,And I got a little bit upset that our Republicans friends suffer from a very serious illness called amnesia.,You know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court.,
,,,,,,,,"They forgot what the economy of this country was like seven years ago when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, when we were running up a $1.","I'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act.",
,,,,,,,,"4 trillion deficit, and by the way, the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse.",I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate.,
,,,,,,,,"President Obama and Vice President Biden have taken us a very, very long way from those dismal days.",It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research.,
,,,,,,,,Are we where we want to be today?,Supreme Court comes along.,
,,,,,,,,No.,"They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W.",
,,,,,,,,But we have come a long way and President Obama deserves an enormous amount of credit for that.,Bush.,
,,,,,,,,Unbelievable.,That is one of our problems.,
,,,,,,,,Thank you very much for your question.,They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is.,
,,,,,,,,It is a crisis here in New Hampshire.,So they have given way too much power to corporations.,
,,,,,,,,"And by the way, there's a crisis in Vermont.","They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don't share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back.",
,,,,,,,,You may recall our governor gave his state of the union speech a year ago on this issue.,We have to preserve marriage equality.,
,,,,,,,,"Because, you know, people think, well, New Hampshire and Vermont, these are rural states, not a problem.",We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community|,
,,,,,,,,"You're right, it is a terrible problem.",We've got to make sure to preserve Roe v.,
,,,,,,,,What do we do?,"Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.",
,,,,,,,,"For a start, we understand that substance abuse and addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue.",We've got work to do|,
,,,,,,,,"And when I talk about moving toward universal health care, what I understand that to be, and it is absolutely imperative that it be, is understanding that mental health and addiction is part of health care.",we've got to make sure to preserve Roe v.,
,,,,,,,,And what that means is that when people need treatment they shouldn't have to wait three months.,"Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.",
,,,,,,,,"When they need it, they should be able to get it.","We've got work to do and here's how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices.",
,,,,,,,,So that means we need a revolution in this country in mental health care to address the causes of addiction and provide treatment.,"I'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power.",
,,,,,,,,"And I was to a treatment center in Manchester, which is kind of peer-oriented.","If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it.",
,,,,,,,,Former people who had addiction work with other people.,So I have very strong feelings about what I'll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court.,
,,,,,,,,That's one approach.,Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,There are many other approaches.,"Well, first of all, thank you for being here.",
,,,,,,,,"But the bottom line is we have a very, very serious crisis in this country.",Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support.,
,,,,,,,,"And we have got to make sure that when people need the help, they get the help.",And I really appreciate your asking the question.,
,,,,,,,,"And the other question that we have to ask is, and it's a tough question.","And I have to tell you, this is the first time I've been asked that question.",
,,,,,,,,Nobody I know knows the answer.,"And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country.",
,,,,,,,,Why is it?,"There are states, as you know that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals.",
,,,,,,,,Why is it?,But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors.,
,,,,,,,,"One of the reasons, by the way, is I think that doctors are prescribing opiates in a way that they have got to cut back a little bit on.","So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective.",
,,,,,,,,They're giving out a whole lot of pills.,So here's how I think about it.,
,,,,,,,,A friend of mine got a molar removed.,"I want -- I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I -- I believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more often.",
,,,,,,,,They got 50 very strong painkilling drugs.,"We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses.",
,,,,,,,,And these drugs are rampant.,So I don't have any easy or glib answer for you.,
,,,,,,,,"Kids are using them, getting addicted then getting into heroin.","I think I would want to really immerse myself in the -- the -- the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings.",
,,,,,,,,"So I think we got to talk to the pharmaceutical industry about what they're producing, doctors what they're prescribing.","I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach.",
,,,,,,,,And then we have to make treatment available to people when they need it.,I'd like to know what their experience has been.,
,,,,,,,,First name is?,"Because we -- we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress.",
,,,,,,,,Raul.,And that is a difficult line to draw.,
,,,,,,,,Good.,So I thank you -- I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we're all going to have to do some thinking about.,
,,,,,,,,Good.,"Hi, Michael.",
,,,,,,,,Excellent question.,"No, I can't, Michael.",
,,,,,,,,"Look, in the real world there are people -- I hesitate to say this in this room, but there are people who like Donald Trump.","I mean I -- I'd like to be able to say I could, but here's what I can say.",
,,,,,,,,I know.,"I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years.",
,,,,,,,,"Not in this room, but there are.",And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice.,
,,,,,,,,And you know that's the world.,That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans.,
,,,,,,,,We are a diverse political nation.,"And military force must always be a last resort, not a first choice.",
,,,,,,,,And there are people who like and respect Hillary Clinton and people who like me and so forth and so on.,That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans.,
,,,,,,,,And I don't object.,I worked very hard as Secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict.,
,,,,,,,,Somebody will stand up and say I support Hillary Clinton.,"That's why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place.",
,,,,,,,,That's fine you know.,"I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict.",
,,,,,,,,"But what I don't -- I object to is people say well Bernie, I really like you.","I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts.",
,,,,,,,,I like your ideas.,But I can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America's best vital national security interest.,
,,,,,,,,I like your record.,So I want to be honest with you.,
,,,,,,,,But I'm not going to vote for you because you can't win.,"I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions.",
,,,,,,,,OK.,I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria.,
,,,,,,,,So let me address that issue.,That is off the table.,
,,,,,,,,"Number one, I'm not a great fan of polls, not even CNN polls.",That would be a terrible mistake.,
,,,,,,,,"But CNN had a poll, as I recall.","We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face.",
,,,,,,,,And what that poll said is that Bernie Sanders ran significantly better against Donald Trump than did Hillary Clinton.,"You know, the network of terrorist organizations -- not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia -- pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves.",
,,,,,,,,OK.,"And we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat.",
,,,,,,,,There was another poll said the same thing because among other things I do very well with Independents.,"So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what's at stake.",
,,,,,,,,And that's one of the reasons why we are doing well against Republicans.,And I know you can understand why there can't be from me anyway a blanket statement.,
,,,,,,,,"So number one, some of these polls have me way, way ahead of Donald Trump, further so than Sec.","But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners.",
,,,,,,,,Clinton.,"You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here's the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts.",
,,,,,,,,"Number two, look at battleground states like New Hampshire.","That, if we're going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military.",
,,,,,,,,"The last poll that I saw in New Hampshire had me 19 points ahead of Trump, Sec.","I, I have to think about whether I think it's necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending.",
,,,,,,,,Clinton 1 point.,"You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country.",
,,,,,,,,OK.,The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that's going to come out.,
,,,,,,,,"Similar results, not quite so strong, in Iowa and Wisconsin.","Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if -- if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it.",
,,,,,,,,OK.,I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system.,
,,,,,,,,"Polls, forget polls.",So I just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation.,
,,,,,,,,They go up and down.,"Hi, Rebecca.",
,,,,,,,,What else?,"Oh, I think that's a very fair question.",
,,,,,,,,Democrats win elections when there is a large voter turnout.,"You know, I did|",
,,,,,,,,That's what Obama did in 2008.,QUESTION: was a mistake.,
,,,,,,,,Republicans win elections when people are demoralized and give up on the political process.,What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn't make a mistake of that magnitude again?,
,,,,,,,,"I believe, and I think an objective assessment of my campaign and Sec.","Oh, I think that's a very fair question.",
,,,,,,,,Clinton's campaign -- she's running a good campaign.,You know I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake.,
,,,,,,,,But I think an objective assessment would say that there is more excitement and energy in our campaign.,And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq.,
,,,,,,,,We are bringing out working class people who have previously given up on politics.,The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections.,
,,,,,,,,We are bringing out large numbers of young people.,And he made that comment.,
,,,,,,,,So if you want to win in November.,And the U.,
,,,,,,,,And I want us to defeat Republicans.,N.,
,,,,,,,,Sec.,"Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out.",
,,,,,,,,Clinton wants us to defeat Republicans.,"Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD.",
,,,,,,,,Everybody in this room understands that we don't want some right-wing Republican in the Oval Office.,And the Bush administration didn't give them the time.,
,,,,,,,,"But I believe, quite honestly that I am the strongest candidate to do that because I think I can drive a large voter turnout, bring in new energy into the Democratic Party.","And that was a breach of faith, in my view.",
,,,,,,,,This is what I would say.,"But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion.",
,,,,,,,,I would say that examine Trump's record carefully.,Turned out not to be.,
,,,,,,,,"And it is not only his bigoted remarks against Latinos suggesting that Mexicans coming into this country are rapists, or criminals, or drug dealers, or his absurd remark that we should not allow Muslims into this country -- even above and beyond those outrageous bigoted statements, take a look at what he stand for economically.",And I really regret that that's the way President Bush proceeded.,
,,,,,,,,This country has millions of people struggling economically.,That would not be something you would have to worry about with me.,
,,,,,,,,I believe we should raise the minimum wage to $15 over the next couple of years.,"If I tell you we're going to do diplomacy, we're going to hang tough, we're going to get answers, that's exactly what we will do.",
,,,,,,,,"Trumps says, no, $7.","Hi, Sean.",
,,,,,,,,"25, we should not raise the minimum wage.","Well, Sean, I had a lot of practice.",
,,,,,,,,Most workers don't agree with that.,"So I could laugh up here, but it's not easy.",
,,,,,,,,Trump in a Republican debated said wage are too high in America.,It is a brutal experience.,
,,,,,,,,Really?,And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care.,
,,,,,,,,Too high in America?,And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself.,
,,,,,,,,That's what he said in a Republican debate.,"What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying.",
,,,,,,,,And here's the other one that kind of blows me away.,I was just stunned.,
,,,,,,,,"Trump is, as you know, a well-know, a well-known scientist, brilliant scientist.",I could not understand how they got away with it.,
,,,,,,,,"And he has concluded, after years of studying the issue, that climate change is a hoax brought to us by the Chinese.","And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally.",
,,,,,,,,"Now that shocked me, Anderson, because I thought that he would have thought it was a hoax brought to us by the Mexicans or the Muslims.",And by that I mean this.,
,,,,,,,,Chinese I didn't quite get.,The very fair question from Rebecca.,
,,,,,,,,"But the point is, if you examine his agenda, it is not an agenda for working Americans.","People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously.",
,,,,,,,,He wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of one percent.,"There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you.",
,,,,,,,,"So I think -- and I would love the opportunity, frankly I'm prejudiced, I want Trump to win the Republican nomination -- and I would love the opportunity to run against him.","But don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks.",
,,,,,,,,I think we would win by a lot.,"And so now that I've been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed.",
,,,,,,,,I have a small Chevrolet.,They play to keep.,
,,,,,,,,It is one of the smallest Chevys that they make.,They play to destroy.,
,,,,,,,,"Yeh, it's about five years old.",They are constantly doing whatever they can to win.,
,,,,,,,,A red car.,"And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can't otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack.",
,,,,,,,,"Pretty good on mileage, but yeh.","So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me.",
,,,,,,,,I wouldn't go that far.,Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me.,
,,,,,,,,People in Vermont and New Hampshire would laugh at me.,I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say.,
,,,,,,,,"What I do do is, you know, we have a wood stove and I, you know.","And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies.",
,,,,,,,,Let me just say this.,So I know I have to keep defending against them.,
,,,,,,,,"If you're looking at a President who can carry a tune, I'm not the guy.",But I'm the one who has the experience to do that.,
,,,,,,,,"I hope I have other attributes, but singing is not one of them.","It's unlike anything you've ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks.",
,,,,,,,,It's the worst album.,And now the Koch brothers say they're going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee.,
,,,,,,,,Actually it's selling very well because people are buying it.,"I'm still standing, and I will be standing.",
,,,,,,,,It's the worst album ever recorded.,So don't worry about that.,
,,,,,,,,People can't believe how bad it is.,Right.,
,,,,,,,,"Anderson, I'm going to|",Don't you?,
,,,,,,,,I know you've been in journalism for a long time.,Yes.,
,,,,,,,,It's true.,It's gotten even better funded.,
,,,,,,,,I am Larry David.,You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in.,
,,,,,,,,And you didn't get it.,"And look, these guys play for keeps.",
,,,,,,,,"I think my proudest general moment is being married for 27 years, having four great kids, some of whom are here tonight, and seven very beautiful grandchildren.",They want to control our country.,
,,,,,,,,"Tell em, Jane.",Yes.,
,,,,,,,,Integrity.,It has gotten even better funded.,
,,,,,,,,OK.,"You know, they brought in some new multi-billionaires to pump the money in.",
,,,,,,,,"Thank you very much, and thanks for hosting this .","And, look, these guys play for keeps.",
,,,,,,,,I ve enjoyed it.,They want to control our country.,
,,,,,,,,This is called democracy and I love this.,Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely.,
,,,,,,,,Our country faces enormous problems.,"They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality.",
,,,,,,,,"And if I believe that establishment politics and establishment economics could solve the problems, I would not be running for President.","They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to.",
,,,,,,,,The sad truth is that we have a rigged economic system.,"But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions.",
,,,,,,,,People are working longer hours for lower wages.,They want to go after any economic interests that they don't believe they can control.,
,,,,,,,,Almost all new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent and we have a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining democracy and allowing billionaires to buy elections.,They want to destroy our balance of power.,
,,,,,,,,"If elected president, I will do my best, working with the American people, as we revitalize our democracy, to take those issues on, to rebuild the American middle class and become the country that all of us know that we have the potential to be.",They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding.,
,,,,,,,,Thank you all very much.,"I said today in Dover, you know, I don't think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists.",
,,,,,,,,"Thanks, Anderson.",They're just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers.,
,,,,,,,,,They're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business.,
,,,,,,,,,So this is exactly what they are up to.,
,,,,,,,,,"And, yes it is probably -- look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open.",
,,,,,,,,,"You know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve.",
,,,,,,,,,And they're shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding.,
,,,,,,,,,So just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it.,
,,,,,,,,,But it's going to take everybody working together.,
,,,,,,,,,"Hi, Alison.",
,,,,,,,,,Thank you.,
,,,,,,,,,"Well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what I just said.",
,,,,,,,,,And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is.,
,,,,,,,,,"When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that.",
,,,,,,,,,"And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there's nothing to Benghazi, they don't give it up, they keep coming after it.",
,,,,,,,,,"So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always done.",
,,,,,,,,,I've always been guided by the same values.,
,,,,,,,,,I have always listened to people.,
,,,,,,,,,And I've always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people.,
,,,,,,,,,"So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that.",
,,,,,,,,,"And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who I am, here's what I do, I want to do this with you.",
,,,,,,,,,And I won.,
,,,,,,,,,"And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage.",
,,,,,,,,,"And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama.",
,,,,,,,,,We saw each other very up close and personal.,
,,,,,,,,,"And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience.",
,,,,,,,,,"So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be.",
,,,,,,,,,And I trust the American people.,
,,,,,,,,,I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you.,
,,,,,,,,,And that's what I hope you will understand.,
,,,,,,,,,"Hello, Rabbi.",
,,,,,,,,,Another absolutely wonderful question.,
,,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Rabbi.",
,,,,,,,,,I think about this a lot.,
,,,,,,,,,"Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self-conscious as possible.",
,,,,,,,,,This is hard for me.,
,,,,,,,,,"You know, I never thought I'd be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president.",
,,,,,,,,,I always wanted to be of service.,
,,,,,,,,,"I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do.",
,,,,,,,,,"I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children's Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter.",
,,,,,,,,,I never thought I would do this.,
,,,,,,,,,"And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who -- whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable.",
,,,,,,,,,And that -- that can grip me and make me feel like there's something I can do about that.,
,,,,,,,,,"So I'm constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve?",
,,,,,,,,,"I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another.",
,,,,,,,,,"And I don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can't do it, it's just overwhelming, I have to retreat.",
,,,,,,,,,It's that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country.,
,,,,,,,,,"And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a -- you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me.",
,,,,,,,,,I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with.,
,,,,,,,,,"And, you know, it just gets me grounded.",
,,,,,,,,,He gets up really early to send it to me.,
,,,,,,,,,"So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.",
,,,,,,,,,m|,
,,,,,,,,,"I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services.",
,,,,,,,,,So I really appreciate all that incoming.,
,,,,,,,,,"And the final thing I would say, because again, it's not anything I've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I -- I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years.",
,,,,,,,,,"And so I've had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues.",
,,,,,,,,,"And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns.",
,,,,,,,,,And I -- I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me.,
,,,,,,,,,And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude.,
,,,,,,,,,"So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful.",
,,,,,,,,,"Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe.",
,,,,,,,,,Be grateful for your limitations.,
,,,,,,,,,"Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions.",
,,,,,,,,,"But at the end, be grateful.",
,,,,,,,,,Practice the discipline of gratitude.,
,,,,,,,,,And that has helped me enormously.,
,,,,,,,,,OK.,
,,,,,,,,,OK.,
,,,,,,,,,"Well, look, that's just not the case.",
,,,,,,,,,"And I did represent New York, obviously.",
,,,,,,,,,"There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issue|",
,,,,,,,,,"And I did represent New York, obviously.",
,,,,,,,,,"There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in CEO pay.",
,,,,,,,,,But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what's happening in this campaign sees the same thing.,
,,,,,,,,,"The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me.",
,,,,,,,,,So I just find it kind of a strange argument.,
,,,,,,,,,I happen to agree with Sen.,
,,,,,,,,,Sanders.,
,,,,,,,,,I'm not just going after Wall Street though.,
,,,,,,,,,I think that's too narrow a target.,
,,,,,,,,,I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe.,
,,,,,,,,,It's a perversion.,
,,,,,,,,,It should be stopped.,
,,,,,,,,,"I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price.",
,,,,,,,,,"So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again|",
,,,,,,,,,"And but I just have to -- I have to respectfully say, I think Sen.",
,,,,,,,,,"Sanders' target is too small, I really do.",
,,,,,,,,,You know I respect him going after the big banks.,
,,,,,,,,,I agree with him.,
,,,,,,,,,No bank is too big to fail.,
,,,,,,,,,No executive to powerful to jail.,
,,,,,,,,,But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank.,
,,,,,,,,,"So let's know the next president has to implement, but doesn't have to achieve that.",
,,,,,,,,,Here's what I want to do.,
,,,,,,,,,I want to go after all the other culprits.,
,,,,,,,,,It wasn't just the big banks.,
,,,,,,,,,It was the insurance company AIG.,
,,,,,,,,,It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers.,
,,,,,,,,,It was Countrywide Mortgage.,
,,,,,,,,,It was Wachovia.,
,,,,,,,,,There were a lot of bad actors.,
,,,,,,,,,"And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk.",
,,,,,,,,,So I've got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests.,
,,,,,,,,,"I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy.",
,,,,,,,,,And frankly they are undermining our democracy.,
,,,,,,,,,This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me.,
,,,,,,,,,We bailed them out.,
,,,,,,,,,The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail.,
,,,,,,,,,They didn't care about the millions of jobs.,
,,,,,,,,,Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout.,
,,,,,,,,,It turned out to be a good deal.,
,,,,,,,,,All of us paid for it.,
,,,,,,,,,They paid back the Treasury.,
,,,,,,,,,So we didn't lose any money and we saved millions of jobs.,
,,,,,,,,,And the auto industry just had a great year.,
,,,,,,,,,Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout.,
,,,,,,,,,And now they're not going to pay their taxes?,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to go right after that.,
,,,,,,,,,That is absolutely wrong.,
,,,,,,,,,And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that.,
,,,,,,,,,Look.,
,,,,,,,,,I made speeches to lots of groups.,
,,,,,,,,,I told them what I thought.,
,,,,,,,,,I answered questions.,
,,,,,,,,,"Well, I don't know.",
,,,,,,,,,"That's what they offered, so you know every secretary of State that I know has done that.",
,,,,,,,,,To be honest I wasn't -- I wasn't committed to running.,
,,,,,,,,,I didn't know whether I would or not.,
,,,,,,,,,I didn't.,
,,,,,,,,,You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I'm done.,
,,,,,,,,,"And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me.",
,,,,,,,,,"The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody.",
,,,,,,,,,I did not want to see that happen again.,
,,,,,,,,,I want to defend President Obama's accomplishments and the progress we've made.,
,,,,,,,,,I want to go further.,
,,,,,,,,,"So yes, I was convinced.",
,,,,,,,,,"But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they've influenced me on.",
,,,,,,,,,Just name one thing.,
,,,,,,,,,"I'm out here every day saying I'm going to shut them down, I'm going after them.",
,,,,,,,,,I'm going to jail them if they should be jailed.,
,,,,,,,,,I'm going to break them up.,
,,,,,,,,,I mean they're not giving me very much money now.,
,,,,,,,,,I can tell you that much.,
,,,,,,,,,Fine with me.,
,,,,,,,,,"I'm proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I'm really, really proud of.",
,,,,,,,,,"No, I don't, because, you know, I don't feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they're on notice.",
,,,,,,,,,"Hi, Chris.",
,,,,,,,,,"I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described.",
,,,,,,,,,I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research.,
,,,,,,,,,The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out.,
,,,,,,,,,Because I want you to know what we know from science.,
,,,,,,,,,But I also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research.,
,,,,,,,,,"And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana.",
,,,,,,,,,I support that.,
,,,,,,,,,I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy.,
,,,,,,,,,"We should be learning about what works, what doesn't work.",
,,,,,,,,,Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for.,
,,,,,,,,,Are they right?,
,,,,,,,,,We don't know.,
,,,,,,,,,That's why we have got to do the research.,
,,,,,,,,,"I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you're taking.",
,,,,,,,,,I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people.,
,,,,,,,,,"We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana.",
,,,,,,,,,I just want to make sure it's the right amount and the right kind.,
,,,,,,,,,That's why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible.,
,,,,,,,,,But you said something else which I think is really important.,
,,,,,,,,,We can't be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire.,
,,,,,,,,,Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state.,
,,,,,,,,,"Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they've lost their children.",
,,,,,,,,,"I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose.",
,,,,,,,,,"So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs?",
,,,,,,,,,"There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs.",
,,,,,,,,,There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people.,
,,,,,,,,,So we've got to work on law enforcement.,
,,,,,,,,,"We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin.",
,,,,,,,,,"We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire.",
,,,,,,,,,We've got to put more money into this.,
,,,,,,,,,So all of this to me fits together.,
,,,,,,,,,You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges.,
,,,,,,,,,So that's what I would like to do.,
,,,,,,,,,Hi.,
,,,,,,,,,How old are they?,
,,,,,,,,,"Well, first of all, tell them I'm glad they're interested in politics, and I really mean that.",
,,,,,,,,,I want them to be involved.,
,,,,,,,,,"I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time.",
,,,,,,,,,"I also want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies|",
,,,,,,,,,"I want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South.",
,,,,,,,,,"I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people's rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve.",
,,,,,,,,,"And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady.",
,,,,,,,,,Getting healthcare for our National Guard.,
,,,,,,,,,Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons.,
,,,,,,,,,A long list.,
,,,,,,,,,"And the reason I say that is I think it's very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done.",
,,,,,,,,,"And as I've said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders.",
,,,,,,,,,"But as the Concord Monitor said today in its writing about this, you know, it's, it's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.",
,,,,,,,,,So I don't want to over promise.,
,,,,,,,,,We've got too much of that.,
,,,,,,,,,I want to tell people what I will do.,
,,,,,,,,,I want to be specific because I do want to -- to go back to the question I was asked earlier -- recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America.,
,,,,,,,,,We need to set big goals again.,
,,,,,,,,,I am all for that.,
,,,,,,,,,"I have big, ambitious goals.",
,,,,,,,,,"Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters.",
,,,,,,,,,But I also want them to hold me accountable.,
,,,,,,,,,"I want them to say, OK, how's that actually going to happen?",
,,,,,,,,,What do we have to do to make it?,
,,,,,,,,,We've got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate.,
,,,,,,,,,"Nancy Pelosi has said, we're not going to revisit healthcare.",
,,,,,,,,,We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act.,
,,,,,,,,,That's exactly where I am.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to improve it.,
,,,,,,,,,Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people's lives.,
,,,,,,,,,I am a progressive who gets results.,
,,,,,,,,,And I will be a progressive President who gets results.,
,,,,,,,,,"And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women's ambitions.",
,,,,,,,,,And I'm going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling.,
,,,,,,,,,"I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically.",
,,,,,,,,,"But in their lives, their profession, how they're treated.",
,,,,,,,,,I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment.,
,,,,,,,,,"That's what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that's what I want for your daughters.",
,,,,,,,,,You don't think they know everything?,
,,,,,,,,,"I used to do this in the White House and, you know, I would, I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and I would go walk.",
,,,,,,,,,"And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists.",
,,,,,,,,,"I had the best time, you know.",
,,,,,,,,,"I would, I would end up over on the Mall sometimes, walking around.",
,,,,,,,,,"And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House.",
,,,,,,,,,I'd be happy to.,
,,,,,,,,,"So, you know, there's nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve.",
,,,,,,,,,"So I would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore.",
,,,,,,,,,"You know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don't tell anybody but meet me, you know, there.",
,,,,,,,,,"That's what I, that's what I want to do, and it's what I get the great joy out of.",
,,,,,,,,,I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life.,
,,,,,,,,,"And they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other.",
,,,,,,,,,So anytime that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life.,
,,,,,,,,,And they keep me grounded.,
,,,,,,,,,They keep me honest.,
,,,,,,,,,They deflate my head.,
,,,,,,,,,They deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other.,
,,,,,,,,,So any time I get to spend time with them.,
,,,,,,,,,And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that's the creÕ—me de le resistance|,
,,,,,,,,,She calls me grandma.,
,,,,,,,,,Grandma.,
,,,,,,,,,Yes.,
,,,,,,,,,She's working really hard on words.,
,,,,,,,,,And it was so thrilling.,
,,,,,,,,,They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren't going to leave.,
,,,,,,,,,"And so they got in late the night, Saturday night.",
,,,,,,,,,And Sunday morning I'm getting ready.,
,,,,,,,,,And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything.,
,,,,,,,,,So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me.,
,,,,,,,,,She goes grandma .,
,,,,,,,,,"And honest to goodness, the caucus could've ended right there.",
,,,,,,,,,I would've been perfectly happy saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa.,
,,,,,,,,,So that's where I'd end my day.,
,,,,,,,,,Right.,
,,,,,,,,,She was.,
,,,,,,,,,Right.,
,,,,,,,,,"You know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid.",
,,,,,,,,,"And her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life.",
,,,,,,,,,And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl.,
,,,,,,,,,You know you get knocked down.,
,,,,,,,,,Everybody gets knocked down.,
,,,,,,,,,What matters is whether you get up.,
,,,,,,,,,"And when you get up, what do you do?",
,,,,,,,,,How do you behave?,
,,,,,,,,,Are you going to be bitter?,
,,,,,,,,,Angry?,
,,,,,,,,,Upset?,
,,,,,,,,,"Are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else?",
,,,,,,,,,And I'm sure that's exactly what she'd be saying now.,
,,,,,,,,,She'd be encouraging me.,
,,,,,,,,,"She'd be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it's a brutal business being in politics.",
,,,,,,,,,"And people say things about those you love, whether it's your daughter or someone else.",
,,,,,,,,,So she was very supportive.,
,,,,,,,,,But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time.,
,,,,,,,,,"And so I would sit with her and I would say don't listen to that stuff, mom.",
,,,,,,,,,"And she'd say, well I have to know what they're saying about you.",
,,,,,,,,,And I'd say you know don't put yourself through that.,
,,,,,,,,,And so that would be what she'd be doing now I think too.,
,,,,,,,,,Yes.,
,,,,,,,,,Oh.,
,,,,,,,,,"Well, thank you.",
,,,,,,,,,"Well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary.",
,,,,,,,,,You know I said earlier today some people said well you know Sen.,
,,,,,,,,,Sanders is ahead.,
,,,,,,,,,And I respect that.,
,,,,,,,,,And so maybe you know I should go onto the next state.,
,,,,,,,,,And I said absolutely not.,
,,,,,,,,,New Hampshire has been so good to me and my family.,
,,,,,,,,,And I love campaigning in New Hampshire.,
,,,,,,,,,I love this process.,
,,,,,,,,,"So, you're going to have to put up with me.",
,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to be going around the state, going to as many events as I can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what I am offering.",
,,,,,,,,,I really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people.,
,,,,,,,,,"To get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that's my goal.",
,,,,,,,,,I will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn't even yet recovered from the Great Recession.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to make it work.,
,,,,,,,,,"We're going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people.",
,,,,,,,,,And we're going to defend our rights.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to defend a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to defend Planned Parenthood.,
,,,,,,,,,We're going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against LGBT Americans.,
,,,,,,,,,"And we're going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have 33,000 people a year die from gun violence.",
,,,,,,,,,"So please, join me in this campaign.",
,,,,,,,,,I hope you will come out and vote for me on Tuesday.,
,,,,,,,,,And I will fight for you every single day in the White House.,
,,,,,,,,,Thank you all very much.,
,,,,,,,,,Thank you all.,
,,,,,,,,,"Thank you, guys.",
